    <div class="content markdown-body"><h1 id="problem-setup">Problem setup:</h1>
<p>In quantum error correction, you encode quantum states into logical states made of many qubits in order to improve their resilience to errors. In quantum error detection, you do the same but can only detect the presence of errors and not correct them. In this problem, we will consider a single [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code, which encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits, and investigate how robust logical quantum operations in this code are to quantum errors.</p>
<p>Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3. The two logical qubits are labelled A and B. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> are Pauli matrices. The logical <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.</p>
<p>We will consider different state preparation circuits consisting of controlled not <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gates, where <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> has control qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> and target qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>. As a simple model of quantum errors in hardware, we will suppose that each <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gate in the circuit has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. The probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> indicates the probability of an error in a single two-qubit gate. We will assess the logical infidelity of certain state preparation protocols as a function of the physical infidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subproblem-1">Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>Suppose that we wish to prepare a logical two-qubit GHZ state  <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB}+|11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> in the [[4,2,2]] code. To do so, we use the following state preparation circuit:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
(CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2).
\]</div>
<p>Note that this equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while the quantum operations in the circuit occur in the reverse order (from right-to-left in the above equation). <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a single-qubit Hadamard gate.</p>
<p>What is the physical state fidelity of the final physical 4-qubit state at the end of the circuit as a function of the two-qubit gate error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>?</p></div>

                        <p>Let me understand the problem step by step.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with a [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code:
- 4 physical qubits (labeled 0,1,2,3)
- 2 logical qubits (labeled A,B)
- Stabilizers: XXXX and ZZZZ
- Logical operators:
  - X_A = XIXI
  - X_B = XXII
  - Z_A = ZZII
  - Z_B = ZIZI</p>
<p>We want to prepare a logical GHZ state <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB}+|11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The circuit is:
<span class="arithmatex">\((CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2)\)</span></p>
<p>Reading from right to left:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply H_2</li>
<li>Apply CNOT_{21} (control=2, target=1)</li>
<li>Apply H_0</li>
<li>Apply CNOT_{03} (control=0, target=3)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each CNOT gate has a two-qubit depolarizing error channel that applies one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability p/15.</p>
<p>Let me first work out what the ideal circuit does.</p>
<p>Starting state: |0000⟩</p>
<p>After H_2: (|00⟩ ⊗ (|0⟩ + |1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩) / √2 = (|0000⟩ + |0010⟩) / √2</p>
<p>After CNOT_{21}: 
- |0000⟩ → |0000⟩
- |0010⟩ → |0110⟩
So we have (|0000⟩ + |0110⟩) / √2</p>
<p>After H_0: ((|0⟩ + |1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ (|00⟩ + |11⟩)) / 2 = (|0000⟩ + |0011⟩ + |1000⟩ + |1011⟩) / 2</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully track the quantum state evolution, focusing on precise representation of the qubits after each transformation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll represent the state as a superposition, noting how Hadamard and CNOT gates modify the quantum amplitudes across the four-qubit system.</p>
<p>The state progression reveals the intricate quantum state manipulation, showing how carefully applied gates create entanglement and superposition.</p>
<p>After applying CNOT_{03}, the state transforms, introducing controlled bit flips that modify specific basis states while preserving the overall quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The quantum circuit&rsquo;s operations systematically alter the initial state, generating a complex entangled configuration that reflects the precise quantum gate interactions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m carefully examining the logical basis states, focusing on the stabilizer generators and logical operators that define the quantum error correction code&rsquo;s fundamental structure. The computational basis emerges from the eigenspaces of specific stabilizer measurements, revealing intricate quantum correlations.</p>
<p>The logical operators X_A, X_B, Z_A, and Z_B provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the quantum information encoding, with each operator representing a distinct transformation across the four-qubit system.</p>
<p>I need to identify the precise eigenstates that simultaneously satisfy the stabilizer constraints and logical Z operator conditions, which will reveal the code&rsquo;s fundamental logical basis states.</p>
<p>The normalized logical basis states are:
- |00⟩_L involves |0000⟩ and |1111⟩
- |01⟩_L involves |0011⟩ and |1100⟩
- |10⟩_L involves |0101⟩ and |1010⟩
- |11⟩_L involves |0110⟩ and |1001⟩</p>
<p>These states represent carefully constructed superpositions that maintain specific quantum error correction properties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m checking stabilizer operations on |11⟩_L, finding interesting symmetry behaviors:
- XXXX operation preserves the logical state
- ZZZZ operation maintains the state
- Z_A operation introduces a sign flip, indicating a subtle quantum symmetry</p>
<p>The verification process reveals intricate quantum state preservation mechanisms across different logical qubit representations.</p>
<p>Exploring the logical GHZ state construction, I&rsquo;m seeing an elegant superposition combining basis states through careful quantum state engineering.</p>
<p>The state preparation involves precise quantum operations resulting in a normalized state spanning multiple computational basis configurations. Each component contributes equally, creating a delicate quantum superposition that represents the logical encoded state.</p>
<p>The error analysis introduces a sophisticated depolarizing channel model, where each two-qubit CNOT gate experiences probabilistic quantum noise. This stochastic error mechanism allows random Pauli transformations, capturing the complex quantum decoherence processes inherent in quantum computation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll track the state&rsquo;s evolution through sequential quantum transformations, marking each intermediate representation with specific error channels and unitary operations. The notation systematically captures the quantum state&rsquo;s progression from initial configuration through gate applications and potential noise interactions.</p>
<p>The physical state fidelity calculation requires comparing the final noisy state ρ₄&rsquo; against an ideal quantum state |ψ_ideal⟩, which represents a superposition of four specific basis states. The depolarizing channel introduces probabilistic error mechanisms across the quantum circuit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m examining how errors propagate through quantum gates, noting that each transformation introduces potential noise that modifies the quantum state&rsquo;s coherence and entanglement characteristics.</p>
<p>By systematically analyzing different error scenarios, I can construct a comprehensive model of the state&rsquo;s evolution. The error patterns range from no errors to multiple gate-specific error occurrences, each with distinct probabilities and quantum state transformations.</p>
<p>The key approach involves decomposing the final density matrix into a weighted sum representing these distinct error configurations, allowing precise quantification of quantum state fidelity under noisy conditions.</p>
<p>The matrix captures four fundamental error scenarios: pristine state preservation, single-gate errors, and compound error interactions, providing a nuanced probabilistic description of quantum circuit performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll trace the quantum state transformations, noting how specific Pauli errors modify the initial |0000⟩ state through gate operations.

<p>The subsequent quantum state overlap measurement ⟨ψ|ψ&rsquo;⟩ will involve applying H₂† to the transformed error operator, then H₂, and evaluating the projection onto the initial |0000⟩ state.</p>
<p>I recognize a fundamental property of stabilizer states: the quantum state overlap depends critically on whether the error belongs to the stabilizer group, which determines the projection&rsquo;s magnitude.</p>
<p>For stabilizer states, the quantum state overlap |⟨ψ|E|ψ⟩|² has a binary outcome - either exactly 1 or 0, depending on the error&rsquo;s relationship to the state&rsquo;s stabilizer group.</p>
<p>In this specific case, the stabilizer group contains just four elements: {I, XXXX, ZZZZ, YYYY}, representing a highly constrained quantum system where only a tiny fraction of possible Paulis preserve the state&rsquo;s fidelity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a path to simplify the analysis by leveraging first-order perturbation theory, focusing on single-qubit errors as the primary contributors to state infidelity. Each depolarizing channel introduces a specific infidelity contribution proportional to the number of Paulis that modify the quantum state.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll need to determine the average fidelity for simultaneous errors on specific qubits, which will help refine the overall error characterization.</p>
<p>The quantum state transformation involves a series of gates and noise operations, creating a modified state |ψ&rsquo;⟩ through CNOT and Hadamard gates under depolarizing noise. I&rsquo;ll carefully track how these operations interact with the initial |0000⟩ state.</p>
<p>The key challenge is calculating the fidelity between the original and noisy states, which requires precise quantum state overlap computation. I recognize the complexity might demand a more nuanced approach than my initial algebraic manipulation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m noting there&rsquo;s a standard average fidelity formula for two-qubit depolarizing channels, but I&rsquo;ll need to verify its applicability to this specific scenario.</p>
<p>The density matrix reveals intricate noise interactions across multiple qubits, with terms representing coherent state preservation and probabilistic error contributions. Each term captures different noise scenarios across qubit pairs, weighted by the depolarization probability p.</p>
<p>Calculating the fidelity involves analyzing four distinct matrix components. The first term directly preserves the original state with probability (1-p)². The second and third terms introduce controlled noise processes, each contributing (1-p)p/5. The fourth term represents more complex multi-qubit error interactions, involving tensor transformations and probabilistic amplitudes.</p>
<p>The partial calculation suggests systematic decomposition of quantum noise channels, tracking state fidelity through probabilistic error pathways. When |ψ&rsquo;_P⟩ equals |ψ⟩ for specific Pauli operators on certain qubits, the measurement probability remains 1. However, when |ψ&rsquo;_P⟩ becomes orthogonal to the stabilizer space, the interaction becomes more nuanced. The quantum state&rsquo;s projection depends on whether the operator Q can map the orthogonal state back to the stabilizer space.</p>
<p>I recognize the complexity is increasing, so I&rsquo;ll focus on the essential insight: for small error probabilities, the precise quadratic term becomes less critical. The linear term dominates the analysis.</p>
<p>The final result captures this simplification: F = 1 - 2p + p, representing a probabilistic transformation with minimal higher-order complexity.</p>
<p>The approximation suggests a linear decay in fidelity, with subtle corrections emerging from quantum operator interactions across different qubit subspaces.</p>
<p>Specifically, the expectation values reveal three non-zero Pauli operator contributions for both qubit pairs (2,1) and (0,3), indicating selective quantum correlations that modulate the system&rsquo;s overall fidelity evolution.</p>
<p>These operator expectation values capture the nuanced quantum mechanical behavior, showing how specific two-qubit interactions contribute to the fidelity&rsquo;s functional form.</p>
<p>The fidelity expression emerges as a composite function integrating single and double error probabilities, with p representing the error rate and f_double representing the complex double-error interaction probability.</p>
<p>The mathematical structure suggests a quadratic dependence on the error probability, with distinct weighting factors capturing different error interaction scenarios.</p>
<p>Analyzing the 225 possible error combinations reveals nuanced fidelity characteristics: 9 combinations within the stabilizer group yield perfect fidelity, while the remaining scenarios require detailed computational analysis across different error configurations.</p>
<p>Specifically, when examining errors applied to CNOT gates, certain error patterns preserve the quantum state, creating regions of stability within the error landscape, while others fundamentally alter the quantum information.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculation involves intricate interactions between error types, tracking how specific quantum operations modify the system&rsquo;s quantum state under probabilistic error conditions. By systematically mapping these interactions, we can derive a precise mathematical representation of quantum state preservation.</p>
<p>The final fidelity expression emerges as a complex function balancing error probability, quantum gate interactions, and state preservation mechanisms, capturing the delicate quantum dynamics at the circuit&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>

                      <div class="markdown-body reasoning-body">
                        <p>Let me think about this carefully. We need to compute the logical state fidelity with post-selection on detectable errors.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand what errors are detectable in the [[4,2,2]] code. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>. An error <span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span> is undetectable if it commutes with both stabilizers. </p>
<p>For a Pauli operator <span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span> to commute with <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, it must have an even number of <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y\)</span> operators. For it to commute with <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, it must have an even number of <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>So the undetectable errors are those with:
- Even number of X&rsquo;s and Y&rsquo;s (for commuting with ZZZZ)
- Even number of Z&rsquo;s and Y&rsquo;s (for commuting with XXXX)</p>
<p>This means:
- Even number of X&rsquo;s
- Even number of Y&rsquo;s<br />
- Even number of Z&rsquo;s</p>
<p>The undetectable errors are:
- Weight 0: <span class="arithmatex">\(IIII\)</span> (1)
- Weight 2: All products of two identical Paulis on different qubits (3 choose 2 for each of X,Y,Z = 6*3 = 18)
  Actually wait, let me count more carefully.
  - Two X&rsquo;s: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(XIIX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(IXXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(IXIX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(IIXX\)</span> (6 ways)
  - Two Y&rsquo;s: Similar, 6 ways
  - Two Z&rsquo;s: Similar, 6 ways
  Total: 18
- Weight 4: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, and products of two pairs (3 ways)
  Actually, let me think more carefully. We need all of X,Y,Z to appear an even number of times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll count the weight 4 undetectable errors systematically. There are three types of all-same errors: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> (3 total). Then, for mixed pairs, we have <span class="arithmatex">\(XXYY\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(XXZZ\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(YYZZ\)</span> in various positions. Each pair type can be placed in 6 different ways, totaling 18 additional errors.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of undetectable errors to 1 + 18 + 21 = 40, confirming the careful counting of error types.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group&rsquo;s structure reveals these undetectable errors, with <span class="arithmatex">\(IIII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span> defining the code&rsquo;s error detection characteristics.</p>
<p>An undetectable error must commute with all stabilizers, placing it in the normalizer group. For this [[4,2,2]] code with 4 physical and 2 logical qubits, the normalizer spans 64 total elements, encompassing both stabilizers and logical operators.</p>
<p>The key insight involves understanding how these operators interact within the code&rsquo;s algebraic structure, revealing potential error detection limitations.</p>
<p>In the CNOT error model, 16 two-qubit Pauli errors emerge, with 15 non-identity errors occurring at probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span> each. Post-selection requires carefully tracking error probabilities and logical state preservation under these constraints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll analyze the circuit&rsquo;s error propagation, focusing on how undetectable errors might transform the quantum state without triggering detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>The errors on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span> span a comprehensive set of Pauli interactions, including identity and mixed-basis transformations. Similarly, the errors on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((0,3)\)</span> represent a complex error landscape with multiple potential quantum state modifications.</p>
<p>An undetectable error emerges when the total Pauli error, after circuit propagation, aligns with the stabilizer group&rsquo;s normalizer. This means certain errors can pass unnoticed through the quantum computation.</p>
<p>The ideal quantum state represents a carefully constructed stabilizer state, defined by specific stabilizer generators <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>. When an error <span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span> is introduced at the final stage, the quantum state transforms from its pristine configuration to <span class="arithmatex">\(E|\psi_{\text{ideal}}\rangle\)</span>, potentially introducing subtle quantum state deviations.</p>
<p>The key criterion for an undetectable error is its complete commutation with all stabilizer generators of the original quantum state. This precise condition determines whether the error remains imperceptible within the quantum system&rsquo;s computational framework.</p>
<p>Examining error propagation reveals nuanced transformations. Specifically, errors acting on certain qubit configurations can persist through quantum gates, maintaining their fundamental characteristics even as the circuit evolves.</p>
<p>The total error emerges as a tensor product combining distinct error components, each targeting specific qubit interactions. To remain undetectable, this composite error must satisfy strict commutation requirements with critical stabilizer operators.</p>
<p>By decomposing the error into individual qubit-level transformations, we can systematically analyze its potential to evade detection through precise algebraic constraints.</p>
<p>The commutation analysis involves carefully tracking how each Pauli operator interacts with standard measurement bases, ensuring an even distribution of anti-commuting transformations to prevent observable perturbations.</p>
<p>For error detection on <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span>, we systematically examine each two-qubit configuration, identifying where the parity of X, Y, and Z operators disrupts the desired quantum state stability. The pattern reveals specific combinations that introduce quantum errors, highlighting the delicate balance required in quantum error correction strategies.</p>
<p>The key constraint emerges: maintaining an even count of X, Y, and Z operators to preserve quantum coherence and minimize computational noise.</p>
<p>Critically, only four specific configurations - <span class="arithmatex">\(II\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(XX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YY\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZ\)</span> - satisfy the undetectable error criteria, representing a precise subset of potential quantum state perturbations.</p>
<p>The error probability calculation involves three nuanced scenarios: pure <span class="arithmatex">\(II\)</span> errors, mixed <span class="arithmatex">\(II\)</span> and single-type errors, and complex interactions between <span class="arithmatex">\(XX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YY\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZ\)</span> errors that preserve overall quantum state parity.</p>
<p>The mathematical framework requires careful tracking of error probabilities, distinguishing between independent error occurrences and their combined quantum mechanical implications.</p>
<p>Specifically, the undetectable error scenarios emerge through intricate probability combinations, ranging from identical error types to cross-type quantum error interactions that maintain system undetectability.</p>
<p>The comprehensive probability calculation integrates multiple error pathways, capturing the subtle quantum mechanical error propagation mechanisms across different error manifestations.</p>
<p>By systematically decomposing the probability expression, we reveal a nuanced representation of quantum error dynamics, ultimately converging to a compact probabilistic formulation that encapsulates the system&rsquo;s error resilience characteristics.</p>
<p>To understand the logical state&rsquo;s fidelity after post-selection, I&rsquo;m examining how undetectable errors interact with the quantum system. These errors uniquely preserve the logical GHZ state&rsquo;s fundamental structure by maintaining its stabilizer symmetries. Specifically, any undetectable error either preserves the state exactly or transforms it within the same code space, ensuring the quantum information remains coherent and protected.</p>
<p>The key insight lies in the error&rsquo;s commutation properties with fundamental stabilizer operators <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, which define the logical state&rsquo;s intrinsic symmetries. Within this constrained quantum subspace, undetectable errors effectively act as logical operations, preserving the state&rsquo;s essential quantum information. I&rsquo;m analyzing the undetectable errors in the quantum error correction code. The stabilizers and logical operators form a group of errors that either leave code states unchanged or perform specific logical operations. </p>
<p>For the GHZ state, I notice symmetrical mapping behaviors. <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span> produce equivalent state transformations, while <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> introduce identical phase shifts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m examining undetectable error combinations from different code locations, focusing on the <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((0,3)\)</span> positions. These include identity and two-qubit Pauli errors like <span class="arithmatex">\(XX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YY\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZ\)</span>. The systematic exploration reveals intricate error propagation patterns in the quantum code.</p>
<p>The first undetectable error combination <span class="arithmatex">\((II, II)\)</span> represents a trivial identity transformation with no actual error introduced.</p>
<p>For the next error scenario, I&rsquo;m examining how errors on specific qubit pairs interact. An error <span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span> can be decomposed into tensor products acting on different qubit pairs, allowing systematic analysis of potential undetectable error combinations.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group includes fundamental quantum error correction operators like <span class="arithmatex">\(I\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span>, which help characterize the quantum system&rsquo;s error detection capabilities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on understanding how errors on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((0,3)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span> might create undetectable error pathways, systematically breaking down the possible error configurations. I&rsquo;m exploring logical operators in a quantum error correction code, focusing on how Pauli operators interact with stabilizer generators. The notation involves complex combinations of X and Z operators across different qubits, revealing intricate relationships between logical and physical quantum operations. I&rsquo;m investigating how specific operator combinations map between code states and determine the code&rsquo;s fundamental properties.</p>
<p>The key insight involves understanding how Pauli operators commute with stabilizer generators, which defines the code&rsquo;s logical subspace. By examining these interactions, I can characterize the code&rsquo;s structural behavior and potential transformations between logical qubit states.</p>
<p>My current approach involves systematically mapping operator relationships and exploring their implications for quantum information preservation and manipulation. The stabilizers leave the state unchanged. Logical Pauli operators modify the GHZ state in distinct ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity leaves the state unaltered</li>
<li>Single-qubit X gates create superposition states</li>
<li>Combined X gates can return to the original state or generate new superpositions</li>
<li>Z gates likely introduce phase changes, though details are partially truncated</li>
</ul>
<p>The transformations reveal how logical operators interact with the quantum state, demonstrating the complex dynamics of logical operations in stabilizer codes. I&rsquo;m exploring potential undetectable quantum errors across different gate configurations. The scenarios range from no error occurring to specific two-qubit error combinations. Each error type has an associated probability, with <span class="arithmatex">\((I,I)\)</span> representing the baseline state preservation. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in understanding the logical implications of <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span>, and other correlated error patterns. The probabilities suggest a systematic exploration of error propagation, where each configuration introduces subtle state transformations.</p>
<p>The current analysis focuses on identifying error modes that might not be immediately detectable in the quantum system, with probabilities distributed across different gate interaction scenarios. I&rsquo;ll need to carefully trace how these errors might modify the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|GHZ\rangle\)</span> state without triggering standard error detection mechanisms. I&rsquo;m exploring the post-selected quantum error correction state by examining undetectable errors and their effects on the logical GHZ state. The probability of passing post-selection has already been calculated as <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \frac{8p}{5} + \frac{16p^2}{25}\)</span>. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now investigating which errors preserve the logical GHZ state&rsquo;s fundamental structure. Specifically, I&rsquo;m identifying logical operations that transform the state while maintaining its essential quantum characteristics. The key insight involves understanding how certain undetectable errors can actually represent logical transformations within the [[4,2,2]] quantum error correcting code.</p>
<p>My focus is on determining which operations maintain the state&rsquo;s core quantum coherence, particularly those that preserve the GHZ state up to a phase factor. I&rsquo;m systematically analyzing potential logical operations that could leave the quantum state fundamentally unchanged. I&rsquo;ll explore the potential error combinations systematically. The key observation is examining errors across two qubit pairs: <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((0,3)\)</span>. Each pair can experience different quantum error types like identity, X, Y, and Z operations. By methodically investigating these combinations, I&rsquo;ll determine which total errors might be undetectable stabilizers in this quantum system.</p>
<p>The goal is to comprehensively analyze the 16 possible error combinations, starting with identifying the specific error types possible on each qubit pair. I&rsquo;ll track how these errors interact and potentially cancel out or generate stabilizer-like behaviors.</p>
<p>My initial focus will be on systematically working through the first combinations, carefully tracking the resulting total error and its quantum mechanical implications. The computational approach requires precise tracking of each potential error transformation. I see three key stabilizers that preserve the quantum state: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>. These represent fundamental symmetries in the system. My focus now shifts to understanding the 12 undetectable errors, which seem to involve complex interactions between different Pauli operators. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m considering how these errors can be expressed as a product of a stabilizer and a logical Pauli operation, suggesting a deeper algebraic structure underlying the quantum error correction mechanism.</p>
<p>By manipulating <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> with stabilizers, I&rsquo;m attempting to map it to a standard form of logical operators. The transformation reveals intricate relationships between different Pauli operators, showing how stabilizers can modify the apparent action of an error.</p>
<p>My current strategy involves systematically exploring how these undetectable errors relate to the stabilizer group, seeking to understand their fundamental logical structure through careful algebraic manipulation.</p>
<p>Checking the commutation properties provides critical insights. By examining how <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> interacts with logical X and Z operators across different qubits, I can determine its precise logical classification, revealing it generates a logical Y operator due to its anti-commutation patterns.</p>
<p>The logical computational basis states represent entangled four-qubit configurations, encoding logical information through symmetric superpositions. These states create robust quantum error correction subspaces, enabling protection against local perturbations through carefully constructed quantum states.</p>
<p>The GHZ state represents a fundamental entangled configuration, demonstrating quantum correlations across multiple qubits by creating a superposition of logical basis states.</p>
<p>I examine the action of <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> on these logical states, revealing fascinating symmetry transformations. The operator swaps specific computational basis states, effectively mapping <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> and vice versa, highlighting intricate quantum state manipulations.</p>
<p>These transformations suggest deep connections between logical qubit representations and their underlying quantum dynamics, showcasing the complex interplay of quantum operators within error-correcting quantum systems.</p>
<p>The preservation of the GHZ state under this transformation indicates robust quantum information encoding and potential stability of quantum computational processes.</p>
<p>The systematic exploration reveals nuanced interactions between quantum operators and basis states. Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> demonstrates non-trivial transformations that deviate from the original state&rsquo;s structure, suggesting complex quantum error dynamics.</p>
<p>The computational approach involves methodically examining operator actions across different basis configurations to understand their quantum state manipulation characteristics.</p>
<p>By investigating stabilizer relationships and error commutation properties, I can systematically characterize which quantum errors preserve the GHZ state&rsquo;s fundamental symmetries, focusing on precise algebraic interactions between different quantum operators.</p>
<p>The key strategy involves checking each potential error&rsquo;s compatibility with critical stabilizer generators, which will illuminate the state&rsquo;s robustness against quantum perturbations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll methodically analyze each error&rsquo;s commutation properties, marking those that maintain the state&rsquo;s essential quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> stabilizer shows perfect alignment, commuting with both reference operators. Subsequent checks reveal nuanced interactions: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0X_1X_2Z_3\)</span> demonstrates intriguing symmetry, commuting with <span class="arithmatex">\(X_AX_B\)</span> while disrupting <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_AZ_B\)</span> across specific qubits.</p>
<p>Certain operators like <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0X_1X_2Y_3\)</span> introduce critical anti-commutation challenges, particularly at qubits 0 and 3. The <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0Y_1Y_2X_3\)</span> configuration similarly presents quantum interference, anti-commuting across intermediate qubit states.</p>
<p>These detailed commutation assessments help map the complex quantum landscape, revealing potential instabilities and interaction pathways within the system.</p>
<p>The error-preserving transformations emerge as fundamental symmetry operations: identity, <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> stabilizers. Their probabilistic contributions suggest intricate quantum error dynamics, with each transformation occurring at specific probability scales.</p>
<p>I sense an underlying calculation discrepancy that requires careful re-examination of the probabilistic framework.</p>
<p>Focusing on <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span>, the interaction with <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_AZ_B\)</span> reveals complex anti-commutation properties. The qubit-wise analysis shows nuanced commutation behaviors: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0\)</span> anti-commutes with <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0\)</span>, generating a negative contribution, while <span class="arithmatex">\(X_3\)</span> commutes with <span class="arithmatex">\(I_3\)</span>, introducing a positive factor. The absence of overlap on intermediate qubits further complicates the quantum state preservation mechanism.</p>
<p>This detailed scrutiny confirms <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> cannot preserve the GHZ state, highlighting the delicate quantum mechanical constraints governing state transformations. I verify the stabilizer calculations for the GHZ state. <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> act predictably on basis states, with sign changes for <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle\)</span>. <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_AZ_B\)</span> reveals interesting behavior, returning <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle\)</span> with a different sign. </p>
<p>Checking <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operators, I see they swap basis states systematically. <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span> transform <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle\)</span> in complementary ways, suggesting interesting quantum transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue examining <span class="arithmatex">\(X_AX_B\)</span> action on basis states to understand its quantum dynamics.</p>
<p>An error preserving the GHZ state must commute with all its stabilizers. This means the error cannot disrupt the state&rsquo;s fundamental quantum symmetries, requiring precise alignment with the state&rsquo;s stabilizer group.</p>
<p>The stabilizer generators seem interconnected, with some potential redundancy in their representation. Careful algebraic manipulation reveals complex relationships between these quantum operators.</p>
<p>I need to trace the precise algebraic connections between these stabilizer generators, paying close attention to their explicit quantum transformations.</p>
<p>The group structure appears to have 16 distinct elements, but not all generators may be independently necessary. Further investigation is needed to determine the minimal generating set for this quantum stabilizer group.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring which undetectable error combinations maintain the GHZ state&rsquo;s fundamental quantum properties. Specifically, I want to identify transformations that preserve the state up to a global phase shift.</p>
<p>Initial analysis suggests <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> maintains the state&rsquo;s essential characteristics. I&rsquo;m systematically examining other potential transformations, focusing on how they interact with different basis states and potential phase changes.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> transformation looks particularly interesting, showing asymmetric behavior across different input states - preserving some configurations while introducing phase inversions in others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m developing a methodical strategy to categorize these transformations, recognizing the complexity requires a nuanced approach that considers logical state representations and their quantum mechanical interactions.</p>
<p>The core challenge involves understanding how these undetectable errors fundamentally modify the quantum state&rsquo;s structure without completely disrupting its core quantum information encoding.</p>
<p>My hypothesis centers on two critical error transformation scenarios: either the errors perfectly preserve the GHZ state&rsquo;s integrity or they map it to a completely orthogonal quantum configuration. This binary classification suggests a potential logical fidelity of 1, indicating robust quantum error correction.</p>
<p>The key insight emerges from examining the group-theoretic properties of these undetectable errors, specifically how they interact with the stabilizer subgroup that defines the logical quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental symmetries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in exploring how the normalizer of the stabilizer group constrains potential error transformations, potentially revealing a deeper mathematical structure that guarantees state preservation.</p>
<p>The post-selection mechanism becomes crucial here, effectively filtering out any error pathways that would compromise the quantum information&rsquo;s fundamental coherence. By selectively eliminating detectable error channels, we create a refined quantum state representation with potentially perfect logical fidelity.</p>
<p>The mixture&rsquo;s fidelity calculation hinges on the undetectable errors&rsquo; specific transformation properties. Each error pathway contributes probabilistically, with the key constraint being whether the error preserves or orthogonalizes the original GHZ state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking how the probability distribution of these error transformations will ultimately determine the logical state&rsquo;s integrity, with the critical factor being the proportion of errors that maintain the quantum state&rsquo;s essential structure.</p>
<p>The stabilizer set and error probabilities require careful verification, as my previous classification might not fully capture the nuanced state preservation mechanisms. Some claimed error pathways need more rigorous mathematical examination to confirm their actual effect on the GHZ state.</p>
<p>By systematically applying <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> to basis states, I discover an intriguing transformation pattern. The operator maps basis states in a symmetric manner, effectively swapping logical qubit states. Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> induces a logical state exchange between <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span>, revealing a non-trivial symmetry in the error correction code&rsquo;s structure.</p>
<p>When applied to the GHZ state, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> demonstrates remarkable preservation properties. The operator maintains the quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental characteristics, suggesting robust error protection mechanisms within this quantum error correction framework.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now investigating other potential &ldquo;pure&rdquo; error operators to understand their interaction with the GHZ state, methodically checking each candidate&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> operator reveals an intriguing symmetry, systematically mapping logical qubit states to each other while maintaining the overall quantum state structure. Its ability to swap logical qubits without disrupting the GHZ state&rsquo;s essential quantum coherence highlights fundamental stabilizer properties.</p>
<p>These observations suggest deeper symmetries in quantum error correction strategies, where certain operators can transform quantum states while preserving their core quantum information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking how specific combinations of single-qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operations can implement logical transformations that maintain the quantum state&rsquo;s integrity, revealing elegant quantum computational mechanisms.</p>
<p>The verification process confirms these operators&rsquo; remarkable preservation properties, demonstrating how strategic error correction techniques can manipulate quantum information with precision and stability.</p>
<p>By identifying multiple equivalent implementations like <span class="arithmatex">\((I, X_0X_3)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((X_2X_1, I)\)</span>, I&rsquo;m uncovering the underlying symmetries in quantum error correction strategies for the GHZ state.</p>
<p>The pattern extends similarly for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operations, where complementary combinations like <span class="arithmatex">\((I, Z_0Z_3)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((Z_2Z_1, I)\)</span> emerge as potential logical transformations.</p>
<p>Exploring combinations reveals stabilizer patterns: <span class="arithmatex">\((X_2X_1, X_0X_3)\)</span> produces <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((Y_2Y_1, Y_0Y_3)\)</span> yields <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\((Z_2Z_1, Z_0Z_3)\)</span> generates <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> - each representing fundamental quantum error preservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>These observations suggest a systematic approach to understanding quantum error correction through symmetrical transformations that maintain the core quantum state&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating the mixed error scenario, specifically <span class="arithmatex">\((X_2X_1, Z_0Z_3)\)</span>, which produces an intriguing <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0X_1X_2Z_3\)</span> transformation, potentially revealing deeper quantum logical operations.</p>
<p>By directly computing the action on basis states, I observe a complex mapping that transforms the computational basis states in a symmetric, phase-sensitive manner. The transformation reveals a non-trivial logical operation that maps logical states with sign changes and state permutations.</p>
<p>The computational basis state transformations suggest a sophisticated logical operation that preserves the overall quantum structure while introducing intricate state rearrangements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking eight specific error scenarios that maintain the GHZ state&rsquo;s fundamental properties, with probabilities ranging from <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2/225\)</span>. The first few errors include identity operations and specific two-qubit interactions like <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span>, each contributing distinctly to the overall error landscape.</p>
<p>The total probability calculation reveals a nuanced distribution: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2 + 4p(1-p)/15 + p^2/75\)</span>, capturing the complex interplay between different error types.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m now reconsidering my initial error catalog, specifically focusing on errors occurring in the (2,1) qubit subsystem. These could be a simple identity operation with probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span>, or more complex interactions involving <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span>, or <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The error landscape expands to include similar patterns for the (0,3) qubit subsystem, with identity operations and specific gate interactions each contributing distinct probabilities. The 16 possible error combinations demonstrate a probabilistic matrix ranging from no errors to multiple gate-specific perturbations, each with its precise likelihood determined by the error parameter <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The probability distribution reveals a structured progression from single identity operations to more complex multi-gate error scenarios, systematically mapping out the quantum error space with <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p(1-p)/15\)</span> probability terms.</p>
<p>The final calculation confirms the total probability matches the expected <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{pass}\)</span> value, validating the comprehensive error probability analysis across different gate combinations. The algebraic manipulation simplifies the expression to <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p)/5 + p^2/25\)</span>, demonstrating a clean mathematical representation of the quantum error probabilities.</p>
<p>The preserved GHZ states emerge from specific gate combinations, with <span class="arithmatex">\((I,I)\)</span> representing the highest fidelity scenario at <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span>, and other identity and single-gate error configurations contributing to the overall quantum state preservation probability.</p>
<p>The new set of gate combinations introduces additional error modes like <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,XX)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((ZZ,ZZ)\)</span>, each contributing <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2\)</span> to the total error probability. The symmetry in these error patterns suggests a systematic approach to quantum error characterization.</p>
<p>The pending verification of <span class="arithmatex">\((I,ZZ)\)</span> preservation requires a careful stabilizer analysis, with the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3|GHZ\rangle\)</span> calculation hinting at potential complex interactions beyond direct state transformation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll methodically examine the Pauli operator&rsquo;s logical action by tracking its transformations across logical qubits, focusing on how <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> generators are modified under different gate permutations.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span>, the key observations reveal interesting sign and commutation properties. When applied to various Pauli strings, the operator either negates or preserves the original generator, depending on whether the qubits anti-commute or commute. This systematic analysis suggests a nuanced transformation of logical operators.</p>
<p>The pattern shows <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> introduces sign changes for <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operators intersecting qubit 0, while preserving <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators&rsquo; structure. This implies a non-trivial logical action that depends on specific qubit interactions.</p>
<p>Crucially, this leads to a profound insight: <span class="arithmatex">\((I, Z_0Z_3)\)</span> actually preserves the GHZ state. By carefully checking stabilizer actions, I confirm <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_AZ_B\)</span> stabilizes the logical state, validating the preservation property through direct computational verification.</p>
<p>I systematically catalog GHZ-preserving errors, identifying key logical operations that maintain quantum coherence. These include identity transformations, specific Pauli product operations across logical qubits, and stabilizer-related transformations that leave the fundamental quantum state invariant.</p>
<p>The classification reveals multiple error classes: pure identity operations, cross-qubit Pauli interactions, and complex composite transformations that critically maintain quantum information integrity.</p>
<p>Investigating mixed errors like <span class="arithmatex">\((XX, ZZ)\)</span> becomes crucial. I trace its logical operation, finding it disrupts the GHZ state by anti-commuting with key logical operators <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>, indicating it does not preserve the quantum code&rsquo;s fundamental symmetries.</p>
<p>The operation systematically negates logical operators: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> through Pauli transformations. This suggests a profound symmetry disruption, potentially invalidating the quantum error correction mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m detecting an anomaly where this Pauli transformation fundamentally challenges the code&rsquo;s logical structure, hinting at a deeper computational complexity in error correction strategies.</p>
<p>Analyzing preservation of the GHZ state reveals critical constraints. Some transformations maintain the state&rsquo;s integrity, while others fundamentally alter its quantum information encoding. The combinations <span class="arithmatex">\((I,I)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((I,XX)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((I,ZZ)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,I)\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,XX)\)</span> consistently preserve the quantum state, indicating robust logical operator interactions.</p>
<p>Critically, combinations like <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,ZZ)\)</span> break the state&rsquo;s coherence, suggesting intricate limitations in quantum error correction protocols.</p>
<p>For the <span class="arithmatex">\((I,YY)\)</span> case, the detailed quantum operator manipulation shows complex phase and transformation dynamics, requiring meticulous verification of state preservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking how <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> interacts with <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_2\)</span>, noting key commutation and sign-flipping properties. The critical observation involves how Pauli <span class="arithmatex">\(Y\)</span> operators modify <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operators through specific transformation rules, revealing intricate quantum algebraic relationships.</p>
<p>The analysis centers on understanding how <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_3\)</span> transform <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_2\)</span>, with particular attention to sign changes and commutation properties that emerge during these quantum operator interactions.</p>
<p>Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> demonstrates anti-commutation with multiple logical operators - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> - which fundamentally disrupts the code space&rsquo;s structural integrity and prevents preservation of the GHZ state.</p>
<p>I anticipate several error combinations fail to maintain the GHZ state, including <span class="arithmatex">\((YY, I)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((XX, YY)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((YY, XX)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((YY, ZZ)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((ZZ, XX)\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\((ZZ, YY)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The errors that successfully preserve the GHZ state are more limited. These include <span class="arithmatex">\((I,I)\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> probability, <span class="arithmatex">\((I,XX)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((I,ZZ)\)</span> at <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)p/15\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,I)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((ZZ,I)\)</span> at <span class="arithmatex">\(p(1-p)/15\)</span>, and specific symmetric error combinations like <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,XX)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((YY,YY)\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\((ZZ,ZZ)\)</span> at <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2/225\)</span>.</p>
<p>The total probability of GHZ-preserving errors will be calculated by summing these specific error probabilities.</p>
<p>Simplifying the numerator reveals a complex polynomial involving <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> terms, with coefficients emerging from the different error combinations. The goal is to understand how these error probabilities contribute to maintaining quantum state fidelity.</p>
<p>By rearranging and consolidating terms, I can transform the expression to highlight the relationship between probability components. The key is tracking how <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span> interact across different computational scenarios.</p>
<p>The algebraic manipulation shows a systematic reduction of the original expression, revealing underlying probabilistic structures in quantum error correction mechanisms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m converting terms to establish a consistent denominator, which will help simplify the complex probability calculation. The goal is to align the numerator and denominator representations to enable clearer computational analysis.</p>
<p>By converting each term to a common base of 75 and 25 respectively, I can now express the probability function as a ratio of polynomials. This transformation allows me to manipulate the fractional representation more systematically, revealing the underlying mathematical structure of the probability distribution.</p>
<p>The resulting fraction represents a nuanced relationship between the probability parameter p and the probability function&rsquo;s behavior, with carefully balanced quadratic and linear terms that capture the system&rsquo;s probabilistic dynamics.</p>
<p>The key insight emerges from understanding how undetectable errors interact with the quantum state: since these errors either preserve the GHZ state or map it to an orthogonal state, the logical fidelity becomes fundamentally simple - it equals 1.</p>
<p>This means that post-selection creates a probabilistic mixture where the quantum state is either:
- Maintained in its original <span class="arithmatex">\(|GHZ\rangle\)</span> configuration
- Transformed to a state completely orthogonal to the original</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing the nuance lies in distinguishing between physical and logical state fidelity, which requires careful mathematical consideration of the post-selection process and error probabilities.</p>
<p>The density matrix representation reveals the intricate probabilistic nature of this quantum state transformation, suggesting a deeper understanding requires examining how specific error processes map the initial quantum state.</p>
<p>By tracing out the environment and focusing on the code space, I can see the logical state emerges through a projection that captures the essential quantum information, revealing distinct logical states depending on whether errors preserve the original <span class="arithmatex">\(|GHZ\rangle\)</span> configuration.</p>
<p>The key insight is that not all errors maintain the same logical state, creating a complex mapping between physical error processes and resulting quantum representations.</p>
<p>When examining orthogonality, I realize the distinction between 4-qubit and 2-qubit state spaces fundamentally changes how we interpret quantum error transformations, potentially leading to counterintuitive logical state preservation mechanisms.</p>
<p>My initial calculation requires careful scrutiny, especially regarding undetectable errors that might appear to preserve the GHZ state while subtly altering its logical representation. The nuanced mapping between physical and logical states demands precise tracking of quantum error effects.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity formula captures these complex transformations, reflecting how different error probabilities impact state preservation across the quantum code space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating a specific error scenario involving <span class="arithmatex">\((I, YY)\)</span>, which presents intriguing quantum mechanical implications. The error&rsquo;s interaction with logical operators reveals critical insights about code space topology and error detection mechanisms. Specifically, I&rsquo;m examining whether this error truly remains undetectable or introduces fundamental state orthogonality that would trigger error identification.</p>
<p>The key challenge involves verifying the error&rsquo;s commutation properties with stabilizer generators, which will definitively determine its detectability and potential impact on quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>By carefully checking <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> against stabilizer generators <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, I&rsquo;ve confirmed its undetectable nature through precise anti-commutation calculations that paradoxically preserve quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The normalizer group for the [[4,2,2]] code contains 64 unique Pauli operators, each mapping code states to valid code states while performing intricate logical unitary transformations. This means <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> isn&rsquo;t just a random error, but a sophisticated logical operator that systematically transforms quantum information.</p>
<p>When applied to the logical zero state <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> generates a specific entangled superposition, revealing its complex quantum mechanical behavior through precise state manipulation.</p>
<p>By examining its action on the logical basis states, I can see it creates a non-trivial logical transformation that deviates from the original GHZ state, yet maintains a significant quantum overlap.</p>
<p>The logical state resulting from <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> becomes orthogonal to the target quantum state, indicating a complete loss of quantum information under specific error scenarios.</p>
<p>Different quantum errors systematically reduce the logical fidelity, with each error channel contributing distinct probabilities to state preservation or destruction. I&rsquo;m tracking how specific error combinations impact quantum coherence and state integrity.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation involves carefully mapping error probabilities against state preservation mechanisms, revealing intricate quantum error dynamics.</p>
<p>Examining the error contributions shows nuanced quantum error patterns:
- Single-identity operations maintain GHZ state
- Two-qubit correlated errors have specific preservation probabilities
- Complex error interactions yield fractional state maintenance</p>
<p>These probabilistic error contributions collectively determine the quantum system&rsquo;s resilience and information retention capabilities.</p>
<p>Introducing a variable transformation <span class="arithmatex">\(x = p/(1-p)\)</span> allows algebraic simplification of the fidelity expression, revealing underlying error dynamics through a more compact representation.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculation <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L\)</span> captures the intricate balance between error suppression and state preservation across different quantum error scenarios.</p>
<p>By systematically manipulating the algebraic form, I&rsquo;m exploring potential structural insights into the quantum code&rsquo;s performance characteristics.</p>
<p>The current algebraic form suggests complex interdependencies between error probabilities and logical state fidelity, hinting at nuanced quantum error correction mechanisms.</p>
<p>Specifically, the logical operators reveal intricate interaction patterns: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span> combine to generate <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0X_1X_2I_3\)</span>, while <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> produce <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0Z_1Z_2\)</span>, demonstrating non-trivial commutation relationships that likely encode critical stabilizer group properties.</p>
<p>The stabilizer set includes <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, and two logical operators <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0X_1X_2I_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0Z_1Z_2I_3\)</span>, which capture fundamental symmetries of the quantum system.</p>
<p>When examining error interactions, the first case with <span class="arithmatex">\((XX_{21}, I)\)</span> confirms the <span class="arithmatex">\(X_AX_B\)</span> stabilizer, while the second case involving <span class="arithmatex">\((I, XX_{03})\)</span> seems to be mid-calculation and requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> stabilizer interactions follow a similar pattern, with <span class="arithmatex">\((ZZ_{21}, I)\)</span> validating <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_AZ_B\)</span>, and the <span class="arithmatex">\((I, ZZ_{03})\)</span> case appearing incomplete.</p>
<p>Double error combinations systematically generate code stabilizers:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(XX\)</span> pairs produce <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(YY\)</span> pairs yield <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span> via <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX \cdot ZZZZ\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZ\)</span> pairs generate <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span></p>
<p>These stabilizer group interactions confirm the logical preservation of the GHZ state. The calculation continues with the logical failure rate <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L\)</span>, which involves probability terms and fractional coefficients.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m converting coefficients to a common denominator of 75, revealing the intricate probability interactions across different error scenarios.</p>
<p>Factoring the numerator yields an interesting quadratic: <span class="arithmatex">\(75 - 130p + 56p^2\)</span>. I&rsquo;m exploring potential factorization strategies, specifically checking if this can be represented as <span class="arithmatex">\((a - bp)^2\)</span> or a similar structured form.</p>
<p>By examining the coefficients, I notice potential constraints: <span class="arithmatex">\(a^2 = 75\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(2ab = 130\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(b^2 = 56\)</span>. The <span class="arithmatex">\(b^2 = 56\)</span> condition suggests <span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> might equal <span class="arithmatex">\(2\sqrt{14}\)</span>, hinting at a deeper algebraic relationship within this probability distribution.</p>
<p>Applying the quadratic formula reveals two potential roots: <span class="arithmatex">\(p = 5/4\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p = 15/14\)</span>. However, the factorization doesn&rsquo;t perfectly align with initial expectations, prompting a careful recalculation of the constant term&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>Verifying the arithmetic confirms the constant term matches the original equation. Yet, both roots exceed the physical constraint of <span class="arithmatex">\(p \leq 1\)</span>, indicating a potential modeling issue that requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The proposed solution involves a complex fraction representing the likelihood under different error scenarios. However, the problem&rsquo;s post-selection condition introduces ambiguity between two distinct interpretations of error handling, suggesting the need for careful clarification of the computational approach.</p>
<p>The key challenge lies in precisely understanding what &ldquo;post-selected on all detectable errors&rdquo; truly means in the quantum error detection context. While initial calculations suggest one approach, the nuanced language demands a meticulous review of the underlying assumptions and potential computational pathways.</p>
<p>The current mathematical expression appears intricate, hinting at potential simplification or refinement. The next step involves rigorously verifying the interpretation and ensuring the mathematical representation accurately captures the quantum error detection scenario.</p>
<p>An alternative perspective emerges, exploring scenarios where undetectable errors might either preserve the logical state or transform it to an orthogonal state. This approach suggests a probabilistic mixture that could fundamentally alter the fidelity calculation.</p>
<p>Critically, the focus shifts to understanding how specific errors interact with the logical GHZ state. A careful re-examination of previous assumptions reveals potential misinterpretations about error preservation and state transformation.</p>
<p>The key insight centers on post-selection conditions, specifically keeping only cases where undetectable errors occurred, which dramatically changes the analytical framework.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now calculating a nuanced logical fidelity that accounts for error probabilities through a complex fraction. The denominator and numerator reflect intricate interactions between error rates and quantum state preservation, suggesting a non-trivial relationship between error types and quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The mathematical expression captures subtle quantum mechanical dynamics, where each term represents different error scenarios and their cumulative impact on quantum state integrity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue analyzing the algebraic manipulation to understand how these probability components interrelate and potentially simplify the overall expression.</p>
<p>The denominator transforms through several algebraic steps, systematically reducing complex fractional terms by finding common denominators and combining like terms. Each line represents a strategic rearrangement that progressively simplifies the polynomial structure, revealing underlying mathematical relationships between the coefficients and powers of p.</p>
<p>The key transformations involve redistributing terms, consolidating fractional components, and systematically reducing the complexity of the polynomial representation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious whether this expression might simplify to a constant value, specifically 1, which would represent an elegant and unexpected resolution to the current mathematical exploration.</p>
<p>My systematic investigation involves carefully examining the potential error combinations and their implications for preserving the GHZ state&rsquo;s fundamental properties, methodically categorizing the 16 possible scenarios to understand their symmetries and transformative characteristics.</p>
<p>The stabilizer combinations that maintain the GHZ state include identity operations, cross-product transformations, and specific Pauli matrix interactions across different quantum registers, revealing intricate preservation mechanisms within the quantum error correction framework.</p>
<p>Conversely, the non-preserving combinations introduce more complex transformations that disrupt the delicate quantum state structure, suggesting nuanced interactions between different error types and their potential to destabilize the quantum information.</p>
<p>The specific <span class="arithmatex">\((XX,YY)\)</span> interaction yields an intriguing result, generating a mixed state transformation that partially modifies the original GHZ state&rsquo;s coherence, indicating subtle quantum mechanical interactions between different Pauli matrix representations.</p>
<p>The calculation reveals an orthogonal relationship between transformed states, demonstrating how certain error processes selectively preserve or alter quantum coherence. This suggests a nuanced probabilistic landscape where quantum error dynamics exhibit complex, non-uniform behaviors.</p>
<p>The emerging pattern suggests unequal probabilities for GHZ-preserving quantum error mechanisms, hinting at underlying asymmetries in quantum error correction processes.</p>
<p>Verification confirms the total probability converges to the expected pass probability, validating the intricate quantum error dynamics through precise mathematical reconciliation.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation reveals a nuanced relationship between error probabilities, suggesting a near-unity approximation for small <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> values. I&rsquo;ll carefully expand the fraction to understand its asymptotic behavior.</p>
<p>Investigating the limit reveals an intriguing computational approach, where the ratio approaches unity through careful algebraic manipulation of the error probability terms.</p>
<p>As <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> approaches 1, the expression transforms, hinting at potential boundary conditions in the logical fidelity calculation. The convergence behavior demands precise mathematical scrutiny to fully characterize the system&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>The limit reveals a fascinating result: the fidelity stabilizes at 1/3, suggesting a fundamental constraint in the quantum error correction scheme. This asymptotic behavior provides critical insight into the system&rsquo;s error resilience under increasing error probabilities.</p>
<p>The problem&rsquo;s nuanced interpretation requires careful examination of post-selection mechanisms, focusing on syndrome measurement and error detection strategies that fundamentally shape quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>Comparing fractional representations, I notice an intriguing simplification emerging in the fidelity expression. The numerator and denominator share structural similarities, hinting at potential algebraic reduction. By aligning fractional terms and recognizing equivalent representations, the complex calculation might yield a more elegant formulation.</p>
<p>The emerging pattern suggests the fidelity depends critically on how error probabilities interact within the quantum error correction framework, with subtle shifts in denominators and numerators revealing deeper computational dynamics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about potential connections to the [[4,2,2]] code&rsquo;s error detection properties. While no immediate relationship is apparent, the code&rsquo;s distance-2 characteristic might encode meaningful insights into the fidelity calculation.</p>
<p>My current focus is verifying the calculation&rsquo;s behavior at extreme probability points, particularly checking the result when <span class="arithmatex">\(p=1\)</span> to validate the mathematical model&rsquo;s consistency.</p>
<p>Substituting <span class="arithmatex">\(p=1\)</span> yields <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1/3\)</span>, which confirms the logical fidelity formula&rsquo;s integrity through a precise numerical verification.</p>
<p>The derived fidelity expression captures the probabilistic interactions between error states, providing a nuanced representation of system reliability under varying error conditions.</p>

                        <p>I need to populate the code template with the logical state fidelity expression I derived. From my work above, the logical fidelity is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{(1-p)^2 + \frac{4p(1-p)}{15} + \frac{p^2}{75}}{(1-p)^2 + \frac{2p(1-p)}{5} + \frac{p^2}{25}}
\]</div>
<p>Let me expand this to make it easier to code:
- Numerator: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2 + \frac{4p(1-p)}{15} + \frac{p^2}{75}\)</span>
- Denominator: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2 + \frac{2p(1-p)}{5} + \frac{p^2}{25}\)</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write this in sympy format.</p>
