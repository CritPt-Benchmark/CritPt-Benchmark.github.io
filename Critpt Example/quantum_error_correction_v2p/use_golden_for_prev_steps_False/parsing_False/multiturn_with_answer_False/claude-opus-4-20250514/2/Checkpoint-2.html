    <div class="content markdown-body"><h1 id="problem-setup">Problem setup:</h1>
<p>In quantum error correction, you encode quantum states into logical states made of many qubits in order to improve their resilience to errors. In quantum error detection, you do the same but can only detect the presence of errors and not correct them. In this problem, we will consider a single [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code, which encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits, and investigate how robust logical quantum operations in this code are to quantum errors.</p>
<p>Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3. The two logical qubits are labelled A and B. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> are Pauli matrices. The logical <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.</p>
<p>We will consider different state preparation circuits consisting of controlled not <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gates, where <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> has control qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> and target qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>. As a simple model of quantum errors in hardware, we will suppose that each <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gate in the circuit has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. The probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> indicates the probability of an error in a single two-qubit gate. We will assess the logical infidelity of certain state preparation protocols as a function of the physical infidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subproblem-1">Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>Suppose that we wish to prepare a logical two-qubit GHZ state  <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB}+|11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> in the [[4,2,2]] code. To do so, we use the following state preparation circuit:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
(CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2).
\]</div>
<p>Note that this equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while the quantum operations in the circuit occur in the reverse order (from right-to-left in the above equation). <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a single-qubit Hadamard gate.</p>
<p>What is the physical state fidelity of the final physical 4-qubit state at the end of the circuit as a function of the two-qubit gate error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>?</p></div>

                      <div class="markdown-body reasoning-body">
                        <p>Let me work through this problem step by step.</p>
<p>First, let me understand the [[4,2,2]] code:
- 4 physical qubits (labeled 0,1,2,3)
- 2 logical qubits (labeled A,B)
- Stabilizers: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>
- Logical operators:
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B = XXII\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span></p>
<p>The logical computational basis states are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: stabilized by both <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, with <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|01\rangle_{AB} = |01\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|01\rangle_{AB} = -|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|10\rangle_{AB} = -|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|10\rangle_{AB} = |10\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|11\rangle_{AB} = -|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|11\rangle_{AB} = -|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, the logical computational basis states are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |0101\rangle + |1010\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0001\rangle + |0100\rangle + |1011\rangle + |1110\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0010\rangle + |0111\rangle + |1000\rangle + |1101\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0011\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle + |1100\rangle)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I see how these basis states are constructed with equal superposition of specific four-qubit states, each representing a different logical qubit combination.</p>
<p>Let me verify this. <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> should stabilize all logical states. Checking <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> reveals the stabilizer property, where the operator returns the same state with a potential phase change. The computation shows the state remains invariant under this transformation, confirming the stabilizer&rsquo;s consistency.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group emerges from <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, defining the logical subspace through their +1 eigenspace. I&rsquo;ll focus on selecting computational basis states that satisfy two key constraints: stabilization by both operators and specific eigenstate properties for local <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>The circuit&rsquo;s structure involves strategic <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT\)</span> and Hadamard gates applied to the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> state, suggesting a carefully designed quantum transformation that likely encodes quantum information across the system&rsquo;s qubits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll trace the quantum state evolution step by step, noting how each gate modifies the quantum amplitudes and basis states systematically.</p>
<p>The Hadamard gate on the second qubit creates a superposition, splitting the initial state into two equal amplitude components. The subsequent controlled-NOT operation then entangles these states, progressively building quantum correlations across different qubits.</p>
<p>The controlled-NOT gate at step 4 selectively flips the third qubit&rsquo;s state based on the first qubit&rsquo;s value. This results in precise state transformations where some basis states remain unchanged while others experience targeted bit flips.</p>
<p>The quantum circuit demonstrates how strategic gate applications can manipulate quantum states with remarkable precision, creating intricate superpositions and entangled configurations through controlled quantum operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating the code space&rsquo;s fundamental structure, focusing on identifying simultaneous eigenstates that satisfy the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> constraints. The code&rsquo;s dimensionality suggests a robust two-qubit logical encoding mechanism.</p>
<p>The logical operators reveal intriguing symmetries across the four-qubit system. These operators strategically distribute quantum information, enabling controlled transformations while preserving the code&rsquo;s fundamental properties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring how the joint eigenstates of <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_B\)</span> define the logical computational basis, which will help characterize the quantum error correction scheme&rsquo;s core computational subspace.</p>
<p>The standard construction approach promises to illuminate the underlying algebraic structure of these stabilizer generators, potentially revealing deeper insights into the quantum code&rsquo;s design principles.</p>
<p>Specifically, the logical <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> state emerges through a precise combination of stabilizer projections, yielding a superposition state that encapsulates the code&rsquo;s inherent quantum correlations. The computational basis states are constructed by systematically applying stabilizer operators to the initial reference state, creating entangled logical representations that encode quantum information robustly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll verify the state construction by carefully tracking the projective transformations and their resulting quantum configurations. The key insight involves understanding how the stabilizer generators manipulate the initial computational basis state to generate the desired logical encoding.</p>
<p>The [[4,2,2]] code defines four logical states using symmetric superpositions across a 4-qubit register. Each logical qubit state represents a carefully constructed quantum configuration that maintains specific symmetry properties under stabilizer operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically check the stabilizer behavior by applying <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> across different basis states, tracking how the quantum amplitudes transform while preserving the overall quantum state structure.</p>
<p>For the <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> logical state, the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> operation generates a symmetric superposition that maps precisely back to the original logical state, confirming its stabilizer-invariant nature.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> operation similarly demonstrates fascinating quantum symmetry, with phase transformations that preserve the fundamental quantum configuration while introducing controlled sign modifications across different basis state components.</p>
<p>I need to carefully analyze the code space constraints, examining how the stabilizer generators <span class="arithmatex">\(S_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(S_2\)</span> interact to define the permissible quantum states. The computational basis representations reveal intricate relationships between bit flips and phase shifts that determine the logical qubit&rsquo;s structural integrity.</p>
<p>The stabilizer conditions require a nuanced exploration of how superposition states must transform under these symmetry operations, suggesting my initial encoding requires fundamental reconsideration. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous rewritten thinking by copying over the next thinking to finish the sentence, and then summarize:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{b}_4} \beta = \alpha + \beta\)</span>, which involves the bit-flipped states and their amplitudes. By noting that the complement of each bit satisfies <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{b}_i = 1 - b_i\)</span>, the total complement of bits sums to <span class="arithmatex">\(4 - (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4)\)</span>. This leads to a symmetric condition where the amplitudes of complementary states are related through a phase factor that ensures the symmetry of <span class="arithmatex">\(S_2\)</span>&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>The key observation is how the bit-wise complementation creates a precise relationship between state amplitudes, maintaining a specific phase structure that allows the symmetry operation to act trivially across the quantum states.</p>
<p>The code space emerges from bit strings with an even number of 1&rsquo;s, forming symmetric pairs like <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span>, which are equally weighted in the quantum representation. These paired states create a 4-dimensional subspace with specific symmetry properties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating how logical <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators interact with these basis states. By applying <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A = ZZII\)</span> to different bit configurations, I&rsquo;m checking which states remain invariant under this transformation. So far, the first two basis vectors <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_2\rangle\)</span> appear unchanged by this logical <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operation.</p>
<p>The systematic analysis continues, examining how these logical operators preserve or transform the carefully constructed quantum code space states. I notice <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_B\)</span> behaves differently from <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span>. Some basis states are +1 eigenstates, while others are -1 eigenstates. For <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1\)</span>, the eigenstate is +1, but for <span class="arithmatex">\(v_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_3\)</span>, the eigenstates are -1. The pattern suggests a complex interaction between the Z and I operators in this transformation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing potential inconsistencies in how these logical states map to computational basis states. The eigenvalue relationships hint at a non-trivial encoding strategy that requires careful analysis of the symmetries and transformations.</p>
<p>The current classification of <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_4\rangle\)</span> as <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> seems premature. I need to investigate the precise mapping and symmetry properties more rigorously before drawing definitive conclusions about the logical state representations.</p>
<p>The detailed eigenvalue checks for <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> reveal a pattern of sign changes for states with certain bit configurations, suggesting a more complex stabilizer code structure than initially assumed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically analyze the logical operator <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> by examining its action on different basis states, noting which states get negated and which remain unchanged. This careful examination helps understand the code&rsquo;s quantum error correction properties.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start by using <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> as a reference state to explore the code space&rsquo;s structure, carefully projecting to find the logical basis states.</p>
<p>The normalization process reveals an interesting superposition state proportional to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle\)</span>, which appears to represent a logical zero state with specific symmetry properties.</p>
<p>I verify this state is an eigenstate for both <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_B\)</span> by demonstrating that applying these operators leaves the state unchanged. This suggests the state maintains its fundamental quantum configuration under these transformations.</p>
<p>To construct the next logical basis state, I plan to apply <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span> to the current state, which will likely generate a new logical qubit representation.</p>
<p>The resulting state involves a superposition of two basis states, specifically <span class="arithmatex">\(|1100\rangle + |0011\rangle\)</span>, indicating a controlled quantum state transition.</p>
<p>I then extend this approach to generate <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_L\)</span> by applying <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span>, which produces another superposition state of <span class="arithmatex">\(|1010\rangle + |0101\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>The process continues with an intention to create the final logical basis state by applying both <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span> simultaneously, suggesting a systematic method for constructing a complete logical qubit basis.</p>
<p>Normalizing these transformations yields four distinct logical basis states, each represented as an equal superposition of two computational basis states. These normalized states span the logical qubit space, with specific transformations mapping between them through controlled quantum operations.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal appears to be constructing a logical GHZ state, which represents a key entanglement configuration for quantum error correction and robust quantum computation.</p>

The circuit&rsquo;s two sequential CNOT gates, each followed by this depolarizing process, will probabilistically perturb the initial quantum state.</p>
<p>The channel&rsquo;s mathematical structure suggests a systematic way to model quantum decoherence, where the original state gets mixed with random two-qubit Pauli transformations proportional to the noise parameter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue tracking how this noise progressively modifies the quantum state through each gate operation, starting from the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> basis state.</p>
<p>After applying <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span>, the state becomes <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |0110\rangle)\)</span>. When the depolarizing channel <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{E}_{21}\)</span> is applied, the state transforms probabilistically. I&rsquo;ll represent this as a mixed state <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_1\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span> preserves the original pure state and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> introduces random noise across possible two-qubit transformations.</p>
<p>The key observation is how the depolarizing channel introduces controlled randomness, mixing the original quantum information with a maximally mixed state across the two-qubit subspace. This probabilistic transformation captures the fundamental quantum noise model.</p>
<p>When Hadamard <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> is subsequently applied, the state undergoes a superposition transformation. The Hadamard gate creates quantum interference, spreading the initial state across the computational basis in a way that preserves the overall quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The controlled-NOT gate <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> then entangles specific qubits, followed by an error channel <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{E}_{03}\)</span> that introduces potential quantum noise. I calculate the fidelity by comparing the resulting state <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_3\)</span> against the logical GHZ state, which represents a key entangled quantum configuration.

<h2 id="step-1-understanding-the-target-state">Step 1: Understanding the Target State</h2>
<p>First, let me identify the logical basis states. The [[4,2,2]] code has stabilizers <span class="arithmatex">\(S_1 = XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(S_2 = ZZZZ\)</span>. The logical computational basis states are:</p>
<p>Starting from the reference state <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and projecting onto the code space:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span></p>
<p>Applying the logical X operators:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_L = \bar{X}_B|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0011\rangle + |1100\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_L = \bar{X}_A|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0101\rangle + |1010\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L = \bar{X}_A\bar{X}_B|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)\)</span></p>
<p>The target logical GHZ state is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
|\text{GHZ}\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L + |11\rangle_L) = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)
\]</div>
<h2 id="step-2-circuit-analysis">Step 2: Circuit Analysis</h2>
<p>The circuit <span class="arithmatex">\((CNOT_{03})(H_0)(CNOT_{21})(H_2)\)</span> applied to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>:</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<h2 id="step-3-error-analysis">Step 3: Error Analysis</h2>
<p>The two-qubit depolarizing channel after each CNOT is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathcal{E}_{ij}(\rho) = (1-p)\rho + \frac{p}{15}\sum_{P \neq I} P\rho P^{\dagger}
\]</div>
<p>where the sum is over the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis.</p>
<p>Let <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> denote the error after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> denote the error after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span>. The fidelity is:</p>

<h2 id="step-4-computing-overlaps">Step 4: Computing Overlaps</h2>
<p>Since errors on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span> commute with operations on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((0,3)\)</span>:
- Errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> after the first CNOT propagate as: <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2 \cdot CNOT_{03} \cdot H_0 \cdot E_1 \cdot |\psi_1\rangle = E_2 E_1 |\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> errors (on qubits 2,1):
- Testing all 15 non-identity Paulis, only <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> preserves <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> errors (on qubits 0,3):

<p>Therefore:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

                        <p>This is asking for the logical state fidelity after post-selecting on no detectable errors.</p>
<p>In the [[4,2,2]] code, errors are detectable if they anti-commute with at least one stabilizer (XXXX or ZZZZ).</p>
<p>Let me analyze what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>We start with the circuit that prepares the logical GHZ state</li>
<li>Errors occur after each CNOT gate</li>
<li>We post-select on cases where no detectable error occurred</li>
<li>We calculate the logical fidelity of the resulting state</li>
</ol>
<p>From the previous problem, I know:
- The circuit correctly prepares <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)\)</span> with no errors
- Errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> occur after CNOT_{21} (on qubits 2,1)
- Errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> occur after CNOT_{03} (on qubits 0,3)</p>
<p>For an error to be undetectable, it must commute with both stabilizers XXXX and ZZZZ.</p>
<p>Let me check which two-qubit Paulis on qubits (2,1) commute with both stabilizers:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(I_2I_1\)</span>: commutes with both (identity)
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ<br />
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</p>
<p>For qubits (0,3):
- <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0I_3\)</span>: commutes with both (identity)
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve identified the complete set of undetectable errors for both qubit pairs. These errors can occur without being detected by the stabilizer measurements, which means they won&rsquo;t trigger a post-selection rejection. This is crucial for understanding the potential state modifications that can happen silently during the quantum error correction process.</p>
<p>The next step involves examining how these specific error combinations interact with the logical GHZ state. I&rsquo;ll investigate the effects of each error type, focusing on how they transform the encoded quantum information.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span>, I&rsquo;m starting to analyze its impact on the logical state, carefully tracking the potential phase and amplitude changes that might occur during this transformation.</p>
<p>The calculation reveals that <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span> introduces a negative sign, effectively inverting the entire logical GHZ state. This suggests a specific symmetry in how certain Pauli operators interact with the encoded quantum information.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span>, the computation shows a more nuanced effect, where some basis states maintain their sign while others change, indicating a complex interaction between the error operator and the logical state&rsquo;s structure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully examine the logical basis states to understand their precise composition and how these transformations impact the quantum code&rsquo;s fundamental properties.</p>
<p>The logical states represent a carefully constructed superposition across different four-qubit configurations, each encoding a specific two-qubit logical state through intricate quantum correlations.</p>
<p>When applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> to the logical GHZ state, I observe an interesting orthogonality emerging between different logical state representations, revealing subtle quantum mechanical interactions within the error-correcting code.</p>
<p>The density matrix computation will require tracking the probabilities of undetected errors across specific qubit configurations, suggesting a complex probabilistic landscape of quantum state evolution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically explore error scenarios, noting how different Pauli error combinations transform the initial logical state while maintaining specific probabilistic constraints.</p>
<p>The first few cases demonstrate how identity and small perturbative errors preserve core state characteristics, with probabilities scaling proportionally to the error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the specific case of <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1 = Y_2Y_1, E_2 = I\)</span>, the probability remains <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span>, interestingly producing the same logical state with only a global phase shift. This suggests robustness against certain correlated two-qubit errors.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> error introduces more substantial state modification, transitioning to an equal superposition between computational basis states, highlighting the nuanced error dynamics within the logical encoding.</p>
<p>Continuing to track these probabilistic transformations reveals intricate error correction mechanisms inherent in the logical qubit representation.</p>
<p>The next error configuration involving <span class="arithmatex">\(I\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> presents another symmetric probability of <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\frac{p}{15}\)</span>, maintaining the global phase preservation characteristic of these quantum error scenarios.</p>
<p>For double errors, the quantum state transformations reveal interesting symmetries. Some configurations like <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> maintain the <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span> state, while others introduce a global phase inversion.</p>
<p>Specific double error patterns demonstrate consistent quantum state behavior, with some transformations resulting in an unchanged state and others inducing a sign change, reflecting the intricate quantum error correction dynamics. <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> acts on logical states by considering its relationship to logical operators. The definition involves physical qubits, but the key insight is understanding logical operators up to stabilizer multiplication. The physical operator <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> might relate to logical operations in ways not immediately apparent from direct computation.</p>
<p>Examining the physical state transformation reveals a symmetric pattern of bit flips across the four-qubit system. The operator induces a specific sign change and state permutation that suggests deeper structural properties of the logical encoding.</p>
<p>Exploring the interaction between <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> and the logical GHZ state shows a precise relationship between physical and logical operators. The computation demonstrates how certain tensor products transform the logical state with predictable sign and configuration changes.</p>
<p>Investigating the subsequent operator composition <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3Z_2Z_1\)</span> indicates a systematic approach to understanding quantum state manipulations within this logical subspace. The emerging pattern hints at intricate connections between different operator combinations and their effects on the logical quantum state.</p>
<p>The matrix representation of the <span class="arithmatex">\(Y\)</span> gate reveals critical phase and sign transformations during quantum gate operations, suggesting a nuanced approach to tracking quantum state evolution through precise computational steps.</p>
<p>Applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> to different basis states yields specific phase and sign changes: <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> transforms to <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span> becomes <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span> shifts to <span class="arithmatex">\(-|1111\rangle\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span> converts to <span class="arithmatex">\(-|0000\rangle\)</span>. These transformations demonstrate the complex interactions between quantum gates and computational basis states.</p>
<p>The resulting state represents a symmetric superposition, which when further manipulated by <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> gates, preserves its fundamental logical qubit structure. Specifically, the logical GHZ state remains invariant under these specific gate operations, highlighting its robust quantum encoding.</p>
<p>I compute the gate transformations systematically, noting how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> interacts with basis states. For <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>, the gate leaves the state unchanged, while for <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span>, the gate introduces a phase factor that effectively preserves the state&rsquo;s overall configuration.</p>
<p>When applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span>, I observe a sign change, with each state acquiring a negative phase. This reveals a consistent pattern of gate interactions across different computational basis states.</p>
<p>Combining these observations leads to a simplified representation of the transformed logical qubit state, showing how local Pauli operations modify the quantum information encoded in the logical subspace.</p>
<p>The computation demonstrates that <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> transforms the logical basis states in a predictable manner, preserving the overall quantum state structure while introducing phase variations.</p>
<p>By applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> to the logical GHZ state, I&rsquo;ve shown that <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> remains unchanged and <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> acquires a negative sign. This results in the original GHZ state, confirming the stabilizer property.</p>
<p>The calculation reveals a key symmetry in the logical quantum error correction code, where certain combinations of Pauli operators leave the encoded quantum state invariant.</p>
<p>The probabilities span multiple error scenarios, ranging from single-qubit errors to correlated two-qubit errors, with probabilities scaling as <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)p/15\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2\)</span>. These probabilities capture the intricate error dynamics of the quantum code.</p>
<p>The error configurations include interactions across different qubit pairs, with specific probability distributions reflecting the underlying quantum noise model. Each configuration represents a potential error pathway in the quantum error correction scheme.</p>
<p>The subsequent error scenarios introduce additional complexity, particularly focusing on <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> interactions with identity operations, suggesting nuanced error propagation mechanisms within the quantum system.</p>
<p>The total probability calculation for generating the logical GHZ state involves intricate combinations of error probabilities, capturing the probabilistic nature of quantum state preparation under noisy conditions.</p>
<p>By combining the probabilities of different error scenarios, we derive a comprehensive expression that accounts for successful state generation and potential error modes. The probability includes squared and linear terms of the error parameter, reflecting the complex quantum error correction landscape.</p>
<p>The post-selection success probability integrates multiple quantum state configurations, systematically accounting for different error pathways and their respective likelihoods.</p>
<p>The resulting probability expression simplifies to a quadratic form in the error parameter, capturing the nuanced probability distribution across different quantum states.</p>
<p>The unnormalized density matrix incorporates two distinct quantum states: the GHZ state and an orthogonal perpendicular state, defined as an equal superposition of logical zero and logical one states.</p>
<p>The normalization process involves dividing each state&rsquo;s probability by the total probability, creating a weighted representation that preserves the quantum state&rsquo;s essential characteristics.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation begins by examining the overlap between the GHZ state and the normalized density matrix, suggesting a quantitative measure of quantum state preservation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll compute the fidelity by simplifying the complex probability expressions, focusing on how different error probabilities contribute to the quantum state&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>The numerator&rsquo;s algebraic manipulation reveals intricate relationships between error probabilities, showing how quantum states degrade and interact under different conditions.</p>
<p>By carefully rearranging terms and consolidating <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> coefficients, I&rsquo;m tracking how quantum error correction mechanisms might influence the overall system&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>The denominator&rsquo;s transformation suggests similar complexity in tracking quantum state fidelity, with multiple error probability terms interacting in nuanced ways.</p>
<p>The emerging equation reveals a sophisticated relationship between error probabilities and system resilience, where <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> terms play a critical role in characterizing quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m carefully tracking the probability contributions from different quantum state configurations. These include scenarios involving identity operations and specific two-qubit gate interactions, each contributing a nuanced probability component to the overall system dynamics.</p>
<p>The current analysis suggests multiple pathways through which quantum states can transition, with probabilities ranging from <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> for perfect alignment to fractional probabilities like <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span> representing more complex quantum interactions.</p>

<p>The total probability calculation involves intricate summation of quantum state probabilities, consolidating terms to simplify the complex expression across different quantum configurations.</p>
<p>Probability terms progressively combine, reducing fractional components and revealing underlying quantum state interaction patterns through systematic algebraic manipulation.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation requires careful expansion of both numerator and denominator, methodically transforming polynomial expressions to expose fundamental quantum probability relationships.</p>
<p>Initial algebraic steps involve distributing terms, combining like coefficients, and preparing for further simplification of the quantum probability representation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll consolidate the <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> terms in the numerator, revealing a compact representation that reduces multiple fractional components to a single, more elegant expression.

<h2 id="step-2-effect-of-undetectable-errors-on-the-target-state">Step 2: Effect of Undetectable Errors on the Target State</h2>
<p>From the previous analysis, the target state is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L + |11\rangle_L)
\]</div>
<p>Let me determine how each undetectable error transforms this state:</p>
<p><strong>First CNOT errors (on qubits 2,1):</strong>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = |\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = -|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span> (global phase)
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle - |0110\rangle - |1001\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L - |11\rangle_L)\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Second CNOT errors (on qubits 0,3):</strong>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = |\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = -|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span> (global phase)
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle - |0110\rangle - |1001\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L - |11\rangle_L)\)</span></p>
<h2 id="step-3-combined-error-effects">Step 3: Combined Error Effects</h2>
<p>For combined errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2E_1|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span>, I need to check all combinations:</p>
<p><strong>Errors preserving <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span> (up to phase):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((I,I)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((X_2X_1,I)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((Y_2Y_1,I)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((I,X_0X_3)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\frac{p}{15}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((I,Y_0Y_3)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\frac{p}{15}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((I,Z_0Z_3)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\frac{p}{15}\)</span>
7-14. Eight double-error cases: each with probability <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p^2}{225}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Errors producing orthogonal state:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((Z_2Z_1,I)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span> â†’ <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L - |11\rangle_L)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\((Z_2Z_1,X_0X_3)\)</span>: probability <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p^2}{225}\)</span> â†’ <span class="arithmatex">\(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L - |11\rangle_L)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-4-computing-the-logical-fidelity">Step 4: Computing the Logical Fidelity</h2>
<p>Total probability of getting <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
P_{\text{GHZ}} = (1-p)^2 + \frac{5p(1-p)}{15} + \frac{8p^2}{225} = (1-p)^2 + \frac{p(1-p)}{3} + \frac{8p^2}{225}
\]</div>
<p>Total probability of getting orthogonal state:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
P_{\text{orth}} = \frac{p(1-p)}{15} + \frac{p^2}{225}
\]</div>
<p>Total post-selection probability:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{GHZ}} + P_{\text{orth}} = (1-p)^2 + \frac{2p(1-p)}{5} + \frac{p^2}{25}
\]</div>
<p>The logical fidelity is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{P_{\text{GHZ}}}{P_{\text{total}}} = \frac{(1-p)^2 + \frac{p(1-p)}{3} + \frac{8p^2}{225}}{(1-p)^2 + \frac{2p(1-p)}{5} + \frac{p^2}{25}}
\]</div>
<h2 id="step-5-simplification">Step 5: Simplification</h2>
<p>Multiplying numerator and denominator by 225:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{225(1-p)^2 + 75p(1-p) + 8p^2}{225(1-p)^2 + 90p(1-p) + 9p^2}
\]</div>
<p>Expanding:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{225 - 375p + 158p^2}{225 - 360p + 144p^2}
\]</div>
<p><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = \frac{225 - 375p + 158p^2}{225 - 360p + 144p^2}\)</span></p></div>
