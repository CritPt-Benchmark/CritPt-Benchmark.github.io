    <div class="content markdown-body"><h1 id="problem-setup">Problem setup:</h1>
<p>In quantum error correction, you encode quantum states into logical states made of many qubits in order to improve their resilience to errors. In quantum error detection, you do the same but can only detect the presence of errors and not correct them. In this problem, we will consider a single [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code, which encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits, and investigate how robust logical quantum operations in this code are to quantum errors.</p>
<p>Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3. The two logical qubits are labelled A and B. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> are Pauli matrices. The logical <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.</p>
<p>We will consider different state preparation circuits consisting of controlled not <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gates, where <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> has control qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> and target qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>. As a simple model of quantum errors in hardware, we will suppose that each <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gate in the circuit has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. The probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> indicates the probability of an error in a single two-qubit gate. We will assess the logical infidelity of certain state preparation protocols as a function of the physical infidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subproblem-1">Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>Suppose that we wish to prepare a logical two-qubit GHZ state  <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB}+|11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> in the [[4,2,2]] code. To do so, we use the following state preparation circuit:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
(CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2).
\]</div>
<p>Note that this equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while the quantum operations in the circuit occur in the reverse order (from right-to-left in the above equation). <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a single-qubit Hadamard gate.</p>
<p>What is the physical state fidelity of the final physical 4-qubit state at the end of the circuit as a function of the two-qubit gate error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>?</p></div>

                      <div class="markdown-body reasoning-body">
                        <p>Let me work through this problem step by step.</p>
<p>First, let me understand the [[4,2,2]] code:
- 4 physical qubits (labeled 0,1,2,3)
- 2 logical qubits (labeled A,B)
- Stabilizers: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>
- Logical operators:
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B = XXII\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span></p>
<p>The logical computational basis states are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: stabilized by both <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, with <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|01\rangle_{AB} = |01\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|01\rangle_{AB} = -|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|10\rangle_{AB} = -|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|10\rangle_{AB} = |10\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|11\rangle_{AB} = -|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|11\rangle_{AB} = -|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, the logical computational basis states are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |0101\rangle + |1010\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0001\rangle + |0100\rangle + |1011\rangle + |1110\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0010\rangle + |0111\rangle + |1000\rangle + |1101\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(|0011\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle + |1100\rangle)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I see how these basis states are constructed with equal superposition of specific four-qubit states, each representing a different logical qubit combination.</p>
<p>Let me verify this. <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> should stabilize all logical states. Checking <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> reveals the stabilizer property, where the operator returns the same state with a potential phase change. The computation shows the state remains invariant under this transformation, confirming the stabilizer&rsquo;s consistency.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group emerges from <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, defining the logical subspace through their +1 eigenspace. I&rsquo;ll focus on selecting computational basis states that satisfy two key constraints: stabilization by both operators and specific eigenstate properties for local <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>The circuit&rsquo;s structure involves strategic <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT\)</span> and Hadamard gates applied to the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> state, suggesting a carefully designed quantum transformation that likely encodes quantum information across the system&rsquo;s qubits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll trace the quantum state evolution step by step, noting how each gate modifies the quantum amplitudes and basis states systematically.</p>
<p>The Hadamard gate on the second qubit creates a superposition, splitting the initial state into two equal amplitude components. The subsequent controlled-NOT operation then entangles these states, progressively building quantum correlations across different qubits.</p>
<p>The controlled-NOT gate at step 4 selectively flips the third qubit&rsquo;s state based on the first qubit&rsquo;s value. This results in precise state transformations where some basis states remain unchanged while others experience targeted bit flips.</p>
<p>The quantum circuit demonstrates how strategic gate applications can manipulate quantum states with remarkable precision, creating intricate superpositions and entangled configurations through controlled quantum operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating the code space&rsquo;s fundamental structure, focusing on identifying simultaneous eigenstates that satisfy the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> constraints. The code&rsquo;s dimensionality suggests a robust two-qubit logical encoding mechanism.</p>
<p>The logical operators reveal intriguing symmetries across the four-qubit system. These operators strategically distribute quantum information, enabling controlled transformations while preserving the code&rsquo;s fundamental properties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring how the joint eigenstates of <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_B\)</span> define the logical computational basis, which will help characterize the quantum error correction scheme&rsquo;s core computational subspace.</p>
<p>The standard construction approach promises to illuminate the underlying algebraic structure of these stabilizer generators, potentially revealing deeper insights into the quantum code&rsquo;s design principles.</p>
<p>Specifically, the logical <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> state emerges through a precise combination of stabilizer projections, yielding a superposition state that encapsulates the code&rsquo;s inherent quantum correlations. The computational basis states are constructed by systematically applying stabilizer operators to the initial reference state, creating entangled logical representations that encode quantum information robustly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll verify the state construction by carefully tracking the projective transformations and their resulting quantum configurations. The key insight involves understanding how the stabilizer generators manipulate the initial computational basis state to generate the desired logical encoding.</p>
<p>The [[4,2,2]] code defines four logical states using symmetric superpositions across a 4-qubit register. Each logical qubit state represents a carefully constructed quantum configuration that maintains specific symmetry properties under stabilizer operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically check the stabilizer behavior by applying <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> across different basis states, tracking how the quantum amplitudes transform while preserving the overall quantum state structure.</p>
<p>For the <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> logical state, the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> operation generates a symmetric superposition that maps precisely back to the original logical state, confirming its stabilizer-invariant nature.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> operation similarly demonstrates fascinating quantum symmetry, with phase transformations that preserve the fundamental quantum configuration while introducing controlled sign modifications across different basis state components.</p>
<p>I need to carefully analyze the code space constraints, examining how the stabilizer generators <span class="arithmatex">\(S_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(S_2\)</span> interact to define the permissible quantum states. The computational basis representations reveal intricate relationships between bit flips and phase shifts that determine the logical qubit&rsquo;s structural integrity.</p>
<p>The stabilizer conditions require a nuanced exploration of how superposition states must transform under these symmetry operations, suggesting my initial encoding requires fundamental reconsideration. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous rewritten thinking by copying over the next thinking to finish the sentence, and then summarize:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{b}_4} \beta = \alpha + \beta\)</span>, which involves the bit-flipped states and their amplitudes. By noting that the complement of each bit satisfies <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{b}_i = 1 - b_i\)</span>, the total complement of bits sums to <span class="arithmatex">\(4 - (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4)\)</span>. This leads to a symmetric condition where the amplitudes of complementary states are related through a phase factor that ensures the symmetry of <span class="arithmatex">\(S_2\)</span>&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>The key observation is how the bit-wise complementation creates a precise relationship between state amplitudes, maintaining a specific phase structure that allows the symmetry operation to act trivially across the quantum states.</p>
<p>The code space emerges from bit strings with an even number of 1&rsquo;s, forming symmetric pairs like <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span>, which are equally weighted in the quantum representation. These paired states create a 4-dimensional subspace with specific symmetry properties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating how logical <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators interact with these basis states. By applying <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A = ZZII\)</span> to different bit configurations, I&rsquo;m checking which states remain invariant under this transformation. So far, the first two basis vectors <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_2\rangle\)</span> appear unchanged by this logical <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operation.</p>
<p>The systematic analysis continues, examining how these logical operators preserve or transform the carefully constructed quantum code space states. I notice <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_B\)</span> behaves differently from <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span>. Some basis states are +1 eigenstates, while others are -1 eigenstates. For <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1\)</span>, the eigenstate is +1, but for <span class="arithmatex">\(v_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_3\)</span>, the eigenstates are -1. The pattern suggests a complex interaction between the Z and I operators in this transformation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing potential inconsistencies in how these logical states map to computational basis states. The eigenvalue relationships hint at a non-trivial encoding strategy that requires careful analysis of the symmetries and transformations.</p>
<p>The current classification of <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_4\rangle\)</span> as <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> seems premature. I need to investigate the precise mapping and symmetry properties more rigorously before drawing definitive conclusions about the logical state representations.</p>
<p>The detailed eigenvalue checks for <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> reveal a pattern of sign changes for states with certain bit configurations, suggesting a more complex stabilizer code structure than initially assumed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically analyze the logical operator <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> by examining its action on different basis states, noting which states get negated and which remain unchanged. This careful examination helps understand the code&rsquo;s quantum error correction properties.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start by using <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> as a reference state to explore the code space&rsquo;s structure, carefully projecting to find the logical basis states.</p>
<p>The normalization process reveals an interesting superposition state proportional to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle\)</span>, which appears to represent a logical zero state with specific symmetry properties.</p>
<p>I verify this state is an eigenstate for both <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{Z}_B\)</span> by demonstrating that applying these operators leaves the state unchanged. This suggests the state maintains its fundamental quantum configuration under these transformations.</p>
<p>To construct the next logical basis state, I plan to apply <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span> to the current state, which will likely generate a new logical qubit representation.</p>
<p>The resulting state involves a superposition of two basis states, specifically <span class="arithmatex">\(|1100\rangle + |0011\rangle\)</span>, indicating a controlled quantum state transition.</p>
<p>I then extend this approach to generate <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_L\)</span> by applying <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span>, which produces another superposition state of <span class="arithmatex">\(|1010\rangle + |0101\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>The process continues with an intention to create the final logical basis state by applying both <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span> simultaneously, suggesting a systematic method for constructing a complete logical qubit basis.</p>
<p>Normalizing these transformations yields four distinct logical basis states, each represented as an equal superposition of two computational basis states. These normalized states span the logical qubit space, with specific transformations mapping between them through controlled quantum operations.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal appears to be constructing a logical GHZ state, which represents a key entanglement configuration for quantum error correction and robust quantum computation.</p>

The circuit&rsquo;s two sequential CNOT gates, each followed by this depolarizing process, will probabilistically perturb the initial quantum state.</p>
<p>The channel&rsquo;s mathematical structure suggests a systematic way to model quantum decoherence, where the original state gets mixed with random two-qubit Pauli transformations proportional to the noise parameter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue tracking how this noise progressively modifies the quantum state through each gate operation, starting from the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> basis state.</p>
<p>After applying <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span>, the state becomes <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |0110\rangle)\)</span>. When the depolarizing channel <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{E}_{21}\)</span> is applied, the state transforms probabilistically. I&rsquo;ll represent this as a mixed state <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_1\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span> preserves the original pure state and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> introduces random noise across possible two-qubit transformations.</p>
<p>The key observation is how the depolarizing channel introduces controlled randomness, mixing the original quantum information with a maximally mixed state across the two-qubit subspace. This probabilistic transformation captures the fundamental quantum noise model.</p>
<p>When Hadamard <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> is subsequently applied, the state undergoes a superposition transformation. The Hadamard gate creates quantum interference, spreading the initial state across the computational basis in a way that preserves the overall quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The controlled-NOT gate <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> then entangles specific qubits, followed by an error channel <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{E}_{03}\)</span> that introduces potential quantum noise. I calculate the fidelity by comparing the resulting state <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_3\)</span> against the logical GHZ state, which represents a key entangled quantum configuration.

<h2 id="step-1-understanding-the-target-state">Step 1: Understanding the Target State</h2>
<p>First, let me identify the logical basis states. The [[4,2,2]] code has stabilizers <span class="arithmatex">\(S_1 = XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(S_2 = ZZZZ\)</span>. The logical computational basis states are:</p>
<p>Starting from the reference state <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and projecting onto the code space:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span></p>
<p>Applying the logical X operators:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_L = \bar{X}_B|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0011\rangle + |1100\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_L = \bar{X}_A|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0101\rangle + |1010\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L = \bar{X}_A\bar{X}_B|00\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)\)</span></p>
<p>The target logical GHZ state is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
|\text{GHZ}\rangle_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L + |11\rangle_L) = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)
\]</div>
<h2 id="step-2-circuit-analysis">Step 2: Circuit Analysis</h2>
<p>The circuit <span class="arithmatex">\((CNOT_{03})(H_0)(CNOT_{21})(H_2)\)</span> applied to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>:</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<h2 id="step-3-error-analysis">Step 3: Error Analysis</h2>
<p>The two-qubit depolarizing channel after each CNOT is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathcal{E}_{ij}(\rho) = (1-p)\rho + \frac{p}{15}\sum_{P \neq I} P\rho P^{\dagger}
\]</div>
<p>where the sum is over the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis.</p>
<p>Let <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> denote the error after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> denote the error after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span>. The fidelity is:</p>

<h2 id="step-4-computing-overlaps">Step 4: Computing Overlaps</h2>
<p>Since errors on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((2,1)\)</span> commute with operations on qubits <span class="arithmatex">\((0,3)\)</span>:
- Errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> after the first CNOT propagate as: <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2 \cdot CNOT_{03} \cdot H_0 \cdot E_1 \cdot |\psi_1\rangle = E_2 E_1 |\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> errors (on qubits 2,1):
- Testing all 15 non-identity Paulis, only <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> preserves <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> errors (on qubits 0,3):

<p>Therefore:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

                        <p>This is asking for the logical state fidelity after post-selecting on no detectable errors.</p>
<p>In the [[4,2,2]] code, errors are detectable if they anti-commute with at least one stabilizer (XXXX or ZZZZ).</p>
<p>Let me analyze what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>We start with the circuit that prepares the logical GHZ state</li>
<li>Errors occur after each CNOT gate</li>
<li>We post-select on cases where no detectable error occurred</li>
<li>We calculate the logical fidelity of the resulting state</li>
</ol>
<p>From the previous problem, I know:
- The circuit correctly prepares <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)\)</span> with no errors
- Errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> occur after CNOT_{21} (on qubits 2,1)
- Errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> occur after CNOT_{03} (on qubits 0,3)</p>
<p>For an error to be undetectable, it must commute with both stabilizers XXXX and ZZZZ.</p>
<p>Let me check which two-qubit Paulis on qubits (2,1) commute with both stabilizers:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(I_2I_1\)</span>: commutes with both (identity)
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ<br />
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</p>
<p>For qubits (0,3):
- <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0I_3\)</span>: commutes with both (identity)
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span>: commutes with XXXX, commutes with ZZZZ</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve identified the complete set of undetectable errors for both qubit pairs. These errors can occur without being detected by the stabilizer measurements, which means they won&rsquo;t trigger a post-selection rejection. This is crucial for understanding the potential state modifications that can happen silently during the quantum error correction process.</p>
<p>The next step involves examining how these specific error combinations interact with the logical GHZ state. I&rsquo;ll investigate the effects of each error type, focusing on how they transform the encoded quantum information.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span>, I&rsquo;m starting to analyze its impact on the logical state, carefully tracking the potential phase and amplitude changes that might occur during this transformation.</p>
<p>The calculation reveals that <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2Y_1\)</span> introduces a negative sign, effectively inverting the entire logical GHZ state. This suggests a specific symmetry in how certain Pauli operators interact with the encoded quantum information.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span>, the computation shows a more nuanced effect, where some basis states maintain their sign while others change, indicating a complex interaction between the error operator and the logical state&rsquo;s structure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully examine the logical basis states to understand their precise composition and how these transformations impact the quantum code&rsquo;s fundamental properties.</p>
<p>The logical states represent a carefully constructed superposition across different four-qubit configurations, each encoding a specific two-qubit logical state through intricate quantum correlations.</p>
<p>When applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> to the logical GHZ state, I observe an interesting orthogonality emerging between different logical state representations, revealing subtle quantum mechanical interactions within the error-correcting code.</p>
<p>The density matrix computation will require tracking the probabilities of undetected errors across specific qubit configurations, suggesting a complex probabilistic landscape of quantum state evolution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically explore error scenarios, noting how different Pauli error combinations transform the initial logical state while maintaining specific probabilistic constraints.</p>
<p>The first few cases demonstrate how identity and small perturbative errors preserve core state characteristics, with probabilities scaling proportionally to the error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the specific case of <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1 = Y_2Y_1, E_2 = I\)</span>, the probability remains <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span>, interestingly producing the same logical state with only a global phase shift. This suggests robustness against certain correlated two-qubit errors.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> error introduces more substantial state modification, transitioning to an equal superposition between computational basis states, highlighting the nuanced error dynamics within the logical encoding.</p>
<p>Continuing to track these probabilistic transformations reveals intricate error correction mechanisms inherent in the logical qubit representation.</p>
<p>The next error configuration involving <span class="arithmatex">\(I\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> presents another symmetric probability of <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\frac{p}{15}\)</span>, maintaining the global phase preservation characteristic of these quantum error scenarios.</p>
<p>For double errors, the quantum state transformations reveal interesting symmetries. Some configurations like <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> maintain the <span class="arithmatex">\(|\text{GHZ}_L\rangle\)</span> state, while others introduce a global phase inversion.</p>
<p>Specific double error patterns demonstrate consistent quantum state behavior, with some transformations resulting in an unchanged state and others inducing a sign change, reflecting the intricate quantum error correction dynamics. <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> acts on logical states by considering its relationship to logical operators. The definition involves physical qubits, but the key insight is understanding logical operators up to stabilizer multiplication. The physical operator <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> might relate to logical operations in ways not immediately apparent from direct computation.</p>
<p>Examining the physical state transformation reveals a symmetric pattern of bit flips across the four-qubit system. The operator induces a specific sign change and state permutation that suggests deeper structural properties of the logical encoding.</p>
<p>Exploring the interaction between <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_3\)</span> and the logical GHZ state shows a precise relationship between physical and logical operators. The computation demonstrates how certain tensor products transform the logical state with predictable sign and configuration changes.</p>
<p>Investigating the subsequent operator composition <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3Z_2Z_1\)</span> indicates a systematic approach to understanding quantum state manipulations within this logical subspace. The emerging pattern hints at intricate connections between different operator combinations and their effects on the logical quantum state.</p>
<p>The matrix representation of the <span class="arithmatex">\(Y\)</span> gate reveals critical phase and sign transformations during quantum gate operations, suggesting a nuanced approach to tracking quantum state evolution through precise computational steps.</p>
<p>Applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0Y_3\)</span> to different basis states yields specific phase and sign changes: <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> transforms to <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span> becomes <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span> shifts to <span class="arithmatex">\(-|1111\rangle\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span> converts to <span class="arithmatex">\(-|0000\rangle\)</span>. These transformations demonstrate the complex interactions between quantum gates and computational basis states.</p>
<p>The resulting state represents a symmetric superposition, which when further manipulated by <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> gates, preserves its fundamental logical qubit structure. Specifically, the logical GHZ state remains invariant under these specific gate operations, highlighting its robust quantum encoding.</p>
<p>I compute the gate transformations systematically, noting how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> interacts with basis states. For <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>, the gate leaves the state unchanged, while for <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span>, the gate introduces a phase factor that effectively preserves the state&rsquo;s overall configuration.</p>
<p>When applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span>, I observe a sign change, with each state acquiring a negative phase. This reveals a consistent pattern of gate interactions across different computational basis states.</p>
<p>Combining these observations leads to a simplified representation of the transformed logical qubit state, showing how local Pauli operations modify the quantum information encoded in the logical subspace.</p>
<p>The computation demonstrates that <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> transforms the logical basis states in a predictable manner, preserving the overall quantum state structure while introducing phase variations.</p>
<p>By applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_3\)</span> to the logical GHZ state, I&rsquo;ve shown that <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> remains unchanged and <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> acquires a negative sign. This results in the original GHZ state, confirming the stabilizer property.</p>
<p>The calculation reveals a key symmetry in the logical quantum error correction code, where certain combinations of Pauli operators leave the encoded quantum state invariant.</p>
<p>The probabilities span multiple error scenarios, ranging from single-qubit errors to correlated two-qubit errors, with probabilities scaling as <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)p/15\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2\)</span>. These probabilities capture the intricate error dynamics of the quantum code.</p>
<p>The error configurations include interactions across different qubit pairs, with specific probability distributions reflecting the underlying quantum noise model. Each configuration represents a potential error pathway in the quantum error correction scheme.</p>
<p>The subsequent error scenarios introduce additional complexity, particularly focusing on <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span> interactions with identity operations, suggesting nuanced error propagation mechanisms within the quantum system.</p>
<p>The total probability calculation for generating the logical GHZ state involves intricate combinations of error probabilities, capturing the probabilistic nature of quantum state preparation under noisy conditions.</p>
<p>By combining the probabilities of different error scenarios, we derive a comprehensive expression that accounts for successful state generation and potential error modes. The probability includes squared and linear terms of the error parameter, reflecting the complex quantum error correction landscape.</p>
<p>The post-selection success probability integrates multiple quantum state configurations, systematically accounting for different error pathways and their respective likelihoods.</p>
<p>The resulting probability expression simplifies to a quadratic form in the error parameter, capturing the nuanced probability distribution across different quantum states.</p>
<p>The unnormalized density matrix incorporates two distinct quantum states: the GHZ state and an orthogonal perpendicular state, defined as an equal superposition of logical zero and logical one states.</p>
<p>The normalization process involves dividing each state&rsquo;s probability by the total probability, creating a weighted representation that preserves the quantum state&rsquo;s essential characteristics.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation begins by examining the overlap between the GHZ state and the normalized density matrix, suggesting a quantitative measure of quantum state preservation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll compute the fidelity by simplifying the complex probability expressions, focusing on how different error probabilities contribute to the quantum state&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>The numerator&rsquo;s algebraic manipulation reveals intricate relationships between error probabilities, showing how quantum states degrade and interact under different conditions.</p>
<p>By carefully rearranging terms and consolidating <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> coefficients, I&rsquo;m tracking how quantum error correction mechanisms might influence the overall system&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>The denominator&rsquo;s transformation suggests similar complexity in tracking quantum state fidelity, with multiple error probability terms interacting in nuanced ways.</p>
<p>The emerging equation reveals a sophisticated relationship between error probabilities and system resilience, where <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> terms play a critical role in characterizing quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m carefully tracking the probability contributions from different quantum state configurations. These include scenarios involving identity operations and specific two-qubit gate interactions, each contributing a nuanced probability component to the overall system dynamics.</p>
<p>The current analysis suggests multiple pathways through which quantum states can transition, with probabilities ranging from <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> for perfect alignment to fractional probabilities like <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)\)</span> representing more complex quantum interactions.</p>

<p>The total probability calculation involves intricate summation of quantum state probabilities, consolidating terms to simplify the complex expression across different quantum configurations.</p>
<p>Probability terms progressively combine, reducing fractional components and revealing underlying quantum state interaction patterns through systematic algebraic manipulation.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation requires careful expansion of both numerator and denominator, methodically transforming polynomial expressions to expose fundamental quantum probability relationships.</p>
<p>Initial algebraic steps involve distributing terms, combining like coefficients, and preparing for further simplification of the quantum probability representation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll consolidate the <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> terms in the numerator, revealing a compact representation that reduces multiple fractional components to a single, more elegant expression.

                        <p>Let me work through this step-by-step.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand the circuit. The circuit is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
M_4 (CNOT_{04}) (CNOT_{34}) (CNOT_{23}) (CNOT_{10}) (CNOT_{12}) (H_1)
\]</div>
<p>This is in matrix multiplication order, so the operations occur in reverse:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(H_1\)</span> on qubit 1</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{12}\)</span> with control 1, target 2</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{10}\)</span> with control 1, target 0</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{23}\)</span> with control 2, target 3</li>

<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{04}\)</span> with control 0, target 4</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(M_4\)</span> measure qubit 4</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s trace through this without errors first. We start with <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span> (qubits 0,1,2,3,4).</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(H_1|00000\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |01000\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{12}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |01100\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{10}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |11100\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{23}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |11110\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{34}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |11111\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{04}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |11111\rangle)\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When measuring qubit 4, there are two possible outcomes: <span class="arithmatex">\(|0\rangle\)</span> with 50% probability resulting in <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span>, or <span class="arithmatex">\(|1\rangle\)</span> with 50% probability resulting in <span class="arithmatex">\(|11111\rangle\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical about my previous calculation and need to verify the steps more rigorously.</p>
<p>Tracing the quantum circuit from the initial state <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span>, I carefully apply each gate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hadamard on first qubit creates superposition</li>
<li>CNOT gates progressively entangle qubits</li>
<li>Final state shows equal probability of <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|11111\rangle\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Measurement of qubit 4 will collapse the state to one of these two possibilities.</p>
<p>When measuring qubit 4, the post-selection process reveals two distinct scenarios:
- Zero outcome means qubits 0-3 collapse to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>
- One outcome means qubits 0-3 collapse to <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>This suggests a deeper exploration of the [[4,2,2]] quantum error correction code&rsquo;s logical states might provide additional insights.</p>
<p>The projection of <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> involves complex quantum operations, specifically applying stabilizer generators to transform the initial state into a valid code space representation. This projection introduces multiple quantum state modifications through different stabilizer combinations.</p>
<p>After normalization, the process yields the logical qubit state <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span>, which emerges when the ancilla measurement results in <span class="arithmatex">\(|0\rangle\)</span>. This represents a successful quantum error correction code preparation.</p>
<p>The subsequent analysis focuses on potential quantum errors introduced by two-qubit depolarizing channels following each CNOT gate. These channels probabilistically apply various two-qubit Pauli operators, creating a complex error landscape with 15 potential non-identity transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll track specific error locations:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1\)</span> occurs after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{12}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> follows <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{10}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(E_3\)</span> emerges after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{23}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(E_4\)</span> appears after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{34}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(E_5\)</span> happens after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{04}\)</span></p>
<p>The final quantum state becomes intricate, representing a sequence of CNOT gates and potential error transformations applied to the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span> state.</p>
<p>The ancilla qubit serves a critical error detection mechanism. Its measurement reveals system integrity: a <span class="arithmatex">\(|0\rangle\)</span> indicates no errors, while a <span class="arithmatex">\(|1\rangle\)</span> signals specific error occurrences.</p>
<p>The circuit&rsquo;s quantum state evolves through strategic CNOT operations. After initial Hadamard and CNOT gates, the state transforms to <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00000\rangle + |11110\rangle)\)</span>, demonstrating quantum superposition.</p>
<p>Subsequent CNOT gates like <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{34}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{04}\)</span> propagate and entangle qubit states, with qubit 4 capturing the XOR of qubits 0 and 3.</p>
<p>In error-free scenarios, both quantum branches yield zero ancilla measurements. However, single-qubit errors can trigger distinct measurement outcomes, enabling selective error detection within the quantum system.</p>
<p>Undetectable errors must satisfy two critical constraints: they must commute with the code&rsquo;s stabilizers and preserve the ancilla&rsquo;s measurement state. Specifically, errors flipping both qubits 0 and 3, or neither, won&rsquo;t alter the ancilla&rsquo;s measurement result.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m developing a systematic approach to analyze potential error sequences. The circuit preparation involves post-selection under two key conditions: no detectable errors and a zero ancilla measurement. My goal is to comprehensively map error probabilities and their corresponding logical quantum states.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I&rsquo;ll first establish the circuit&rsquo;s baseline behavior by carefully tracing its state transformations from the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span> configuration, examining how Hadamard and CNOT gates progressively modify the quantum representation.</p>
<p>The measurement of qubit 4 introduces a probabilistic collapse, yielding either <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span> with equal likelihood. Post-selection on the zero state provides a critical starting point for understanding potential error dynamics.</p>
<p>The projection onto the code space reveals a key transformation. By applying specific quantum operators, the state evolves to an unnormalized logical qubit state <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span>, highlighting the circuit&rsquo;s intricate quantum error correction mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m analyzing the circuit&rsquo;s fault-tolerant design, focusing on how single errors might propagate through the quantum gates. The ancilla qubit plays a crucial role in error detection, suggesting a sophisticated approach to maintaining quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The complexity of tracking error propagation requires a systematic breakdown of potential quantum state modifications.</p>
<p>Examining the logical operators and stabilizers provides insight into the code&rsquo;s error detection capabilities. Single-qubit errors that commute with stabilizers remain undetectable, with the identity operation being the only such transformation.</p>
<p>For two-qubit interactions, specific undetectable error patterns emerge. These include the identity operation on both qubits, coordinated X and Z operations, and specific combinations of Y rotations between qubits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to systematically analyze how these potential errors propagate through the quantum circuit, tracing the state evolution and tracking potential error mechanisms.</p>
<p>The key insight is that fault-tolerant circuits should detect most single-qubit errors through ancilla measurements. This means I&rsquo;m looking for sophisticated error patterns that could potentially bypass detection.</p>
<p>My focus will be on identifying error sequences that:
- Maintain the overall quantum state&rsquo;s integrity
- Avoid triggering ancilla qubit state changes
- Represent coordinated, subtle perturbations across multiple qubits</p>
<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;m analyzing error probabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>No error: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5\)</span></li>
<li>Single errors: <span class="arithmatex">\(5p(1-p)^4\)</span></li>
<li>Double errors: <span class="arithmatex">\(10p^2(1-p)^3\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>These probabilities reveal potential scenarios where quantum error correction might fail, particularly in complex multi-qubit interactions where error patterns could strategically &ldquo;cancel out&rdquo; or remain undetected.</p>
<p>The circuit prepares a specific entangled state <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span>. When no errors occur and the ancilla measurement is zero, the state collapses to <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>, which maps to the logical <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating potential undetectable errors that could modify the logical state while maintaining ancilla = 0. These include:
- Logical <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span> transforming to <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_L\)</span>
- Logical <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span> transforming to <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_L\)</span>
- Logical <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\bar{X}_B\)</span> transforming to <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span></p>
<p>The fault-tolerant design means single errors should either trigger the ancilla or preserve the logical state. Double errors present a more complex scenario, potentially implementing logical operations while evading detection.</p>
<p>The critical insight is the circuit&rsquo;s robust error-handling mechanism: single errors are either caught by the ancilla measurement or fundamentally unable to corrupt the quantum information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m breaking down the circuit&rsquo;s structure to understand potential error propagation. The preparation and entanglement stages create a sophisticated error detection framework, with the ancilla playing a crucial role in identifying specific error patterns.</p>
<p>The probabilistic nature of error occurrence suggests a nuanced approach to analyzing potential state corruptions, focusing on how different error combinations might interact with the quantum circuit&rsquo;s inherent protections.</p>
<p>By examining the parity of specific qubit sets and tracking how errors might commute with stabilizer measurements, I can map out scenarios where errors remain undetected or potentially compromise the logical state.</p>
<p>The undetectable error patterns reveal fascinating symmetries in the quantum error correction mechanism, particularly around how certain error transformations preserve the initial quantum information without triggering the ancilla&rsquo;s detection mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on understanding which error combinations maintain the logical zero state while evading the code&rsquo;s error detection capabilities, considering both single and double error scenarios across different qubit interactions.</p>
<p>The key challenge involves identifying precise error patterns that simultaneously satisfy three critical conditions: preserving ancilla measurement, remaining undetectable, and maintaining the intended logical quantum state.</p>
<p>My analysis centers on probabilistic error contributions, particularly examining how specific error sequences might slip past the quantum error correction mechanism without fundamentally altering the encoded quantum information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m systematically exploring error propagation through the stabilizer circuit, recognizing that fault-tolerant design introduces nuanced constraints on potential error transformations.</p>
<p>The dominant fidelity contribution emerges from error-free preparation, with single and double error scenarios presenting increasingly complex computational challenges for precise characterization.</p>
<p>My current focus shifts to granular examination of individual CNOT gate interactions and their potential error susceptibilities, tracing how specific error interventions might subtly modify the quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental properties. I&rsquo;m tracking the complexity of error propagation in a quantum circuit, focusing on fault-tolerant state preparation. The circuit involves 5 CNOTs with an error probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, and I&rsquo;m approximating the logical fidelity.</p>
<p>To first order, the no-error probability is close to 1, with undetectable errors being very low probability. I recognize the need for a systematic approach to identifying specific error patterns that might corrupt the logical state while evading detection tests.</p>
<p>The key challenge is understanding how errors might slip through the ancilla measurements and potentially compromise the quantum information. I&rsquo;ll need to carefully map out potential error scenarios in the [[4,2,2]] code structure. In a well-designed quantum error correction circuit, single errors that bypass detection mechanisms are unlikely to significantly disrupt the logical qubit state. </p>
<p>To first-order approximation, the logical fidelity remains essentially unchanged, with error contributions scaling quadratically with the error probability. I&rsquo;m interested in identifying specific double error patterns that could introduce subtle state modifications.</p>
<p>The circuit preparation involves carefully constructing a quantum state that requires precise tracking of potential error mechanisms across multiple qubits. By systematically analyzing error propagation, I can map out how different error combinations might impact the final logical state.</p>
<p>Starting from the initial state, I&rsquo;ll trace the quantum gates and their potential error transformations, focusing on how CNOT operations might introduce or propagate quantum errors across the multi-qubit system.</p>
<p>When measuring the ancilla qubit as 0, the state collapses to <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span>, representing a logical encoded state. However, subtle error mechanisms could potentially compromise the quantum information.</p>
<p>Specific error scenarios might involve single-qubit X errors that preserve the ancilla&rsquo;s state while subtly altering the underlying quantum information. An X error on qubit 1, for instance, could silently flip the logical state without triggering ancilla detection, presenting a nuanced challenge in quantum error correction.</p>
<p>The key concern involves identifying error patterns that maintain the ancilla&rsquo;s zero state while introducing undetected quantum state modifications across the computational qubits.</p>
<p>Probabilistically, the logical fidelity depends on:
- Perfect state preservation: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5\)</span>
- Single error detection mechanisms
- Double error corruption probability: <span class="arithmatex">\(O(p^2)\)</span></p>
<p>Consequently, the logical fidelity approximates <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L \approx \frac{(1-p)^5}{(1-p)^5 + c \cdot p^2}\)</span>, capturing the delicate balance between error introduction and quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>To first and second order approximations, the fidelity trends toward unity, with subtle <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> corrections emerging from complex error interactions.</p>
<p>Investigating specific error patterns reveals nuanced detection mechanisms. Two-qubit errors exhibit intriguing commutation properties with stabilizer operators, determining their detectability through intricate quantum mechanical interactions.</p>
<p>For an undetectable two-qubit error in the [[4,2,2]] code, only specific error forms are permissible: identity, XX, YY, or ZZ on identical qubits.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation involves a probabilistic ratio, capturing the system&rsquo;s quantum state preservation under noisy conditions. Key contributions arise from error-free scenarios and specific error pattern probabilities, tracking the quantum information&rsquo;s resilience across computational processes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus on understanding how error patterns might subtly corrupt the logical quantum state while evading detection mechanisms. The goal is to characterize the system&rsquo;s fault tolerance by examining how paired errors could potentially implement undetected logical transformations.</p>
<p>The mathematical structure suggests a quadratic error dependence, with the logical fidelity potentially maintaining near-perfect preservation under low-noise conditions. Specific error pair interactions become critical in understanding the quantum error correction&rsquo;s fundamental limits.</p>
<p>Exploring these intricate error pathways reveals how seemingly independent quantum operations could collectively induce subtle logical state modifications, challenging the initial assumption of complete error protection.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity appears bounded by quadratic error probabilities, with specific error pair configurations potentially compromising quantum information integrity without triggering standard detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>Single-qubit errors are systematically detectable in this quantum error correction framework, but two-qubit correlated errors present a more nuanced challenge to maintaining quantum state fidelity.</p>
<p>Investigating undetectable two-qubit Pauli error patterns becomes crucial for understanding the precise boundaries of fault-tolerance in this quantum circuit design.</p>
<p>The key insight involves tracking how error pairs might subtly modify logical states without triggering immediate detection, suggesting a complex interplay between error mechanisms and quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>Analyzing potential error transformations reveals nuanced state modifications: single errors might leave the logical state intact, while paired errors could introduce subtle phase or bit flip variations within the logical subspace. The critical challenge involves precisely characterizing these minute state perturbations at the <span class="arithmatex">\(O(p^2)\)</span> error scale.</p>
<p>Computational basis states demand exact representation, meaning any deviation - even phase shifts - constitutes a meaningful logical error. This necessitates careful enumeration of potential error pathways that could imperceptibly alter the quantum information.</p>
<p>The fundamental goal remains quantifying how probabilistic errors might incrementally degrade the logical state&rsquo;s fidelity, requiring meticulous tracking of potential error transformation mechanisms. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous thinking first, then summarize:</p>
<p>CNOT_04 introduces additional complexity to the error pattern. The two undetectable errors <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1 = X_1X_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(E_5 = X_0X_3\)</span> create an interesting scenario where the errors commute with the stabilizer generators. </p>
<p>The key observation is that these specific error combinations don&rsquo;t necessarily corrupt the logical quantum information. They implement <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, which is a stabilizer, meaning the logical state remains fundamentally unchanged. This reveals a nuanced behavior in quantum error correction where not all error combinations lead to logical state degradation.</p>
<p>To implement a true logical error, more sophisticated error combinations are required, specifically targeting logical operators like <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span>. However, individual two-qubit errors from the noise model cannot directly achieve this transformation.</p>
<p>The analysis suggests a complex error suppression mechanism where certain error patterns preserve the logical quantum state, hinting at the robust nature of the quantum error correction approach.</p>
<p>The fault-tolerant circuit demonstrates remarkable error resilience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean state preparation has high probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5\)</span></li>
<li>Most error patterns are detectable</li>
<li>Logical fidelity remains extremely high, with corrections at <span class="arithmatex">\(O(p^2)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The logical fidelity equation <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \alpha p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span> captures this error suppression, showing how quantum error correction can maintain quantum information integrity.</p>
<p>Undetectable errors emerge from specific two-qubit error patterns:
- Correlated X, Y, Z errors on identical qubit pairs
- Each undetectable error occurs with <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span> probability</p>
<p>The challenge involves meticulously tracking error combinations that:</p>
<ol>

<li>Potentially alter logical qubit state</li>
</ol>
<p>A generalized fidelity expression will capture these nuanced error propagation mechanisms, revealing the delicate balance between error introduction and correction in quantum circuits.</p>
<p>The expected fidelity follows a polynomial expansion in error probability, with second-order terms revealing critical error dynamics. These terms capture both independent and correlated error scenarios across circuit elements.</p>
<p>Specifically, second-order error contributions arise from two distinct scenarios: independent single errors across different circuit locations and simultaneous double errors from identical CNOT operations.</p>
<p>For independent single errors:
- 10 possible two-CNOT error configurations exist
- Each configuration involves 225 unique error combinations
- Probability scales with <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2 (1-p)^3\)</span></p>
<p>For double errors within a single CNOT:
- 5 potential CNOT locations
- 210 unique two-qubit error combinations per location
- Probability characterized by <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2 (1-p)^4\)</span></p>
<p>The complexity suggests nuanced error propagation mechanisms requiring careful probabilistic analysis. At <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span>, two CNOTs experience errors out of five total, with 10 possible error placement configurations. Each configuration involves 225 potential error combinations, occurring at <span class="arithmatex">\((p/15)^2(1-p)^3\)</span> probability.</p>
<p>The goal is to systematically analyze these 2250 two-error scenarios, determining which pass detection tests and map to specific logical states. A fault-tolerant circuit&rsquo;s fidelity depends on carefully characterizing these error patterns.</p>
<p>The expected fidelity structure balances error-free performance against specific two-error correction mechanisms, represented by a ratio comparing ideal and error-influenced circuit behaviors.</p>
<p>The key insight emerges in the coefficient comparing successful <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> preservation versus alternative logical state transitions. This coefficient quantifies the circuit&rsquo;s resilience against specific error configurations, suggesting a linear degradation mechanism at <span class="arithmatex">\(p^2\)</span> scale.</p>
<p>While the exact calculation remains complex, the mathematical framework reveals how quantum error correction fundamentally tracks state preservation probabilities across different error scenarios.</p>
<p>The potential exists for a perfectly designed fault-tolerant circuit where all error patterns maintain the original logical state, though practical implementations likely involve some state corruption probability.</p>
<p>The emerging model suggests a quadratic error suppression mechanism, with a constant <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> capturing the nuanced error dynamics specific to the quantum circuit&rsquo;s architectural design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating the intricate error detection landscape, where single errors might be fully detectable, but subtle two-error combinations could potentially compromise the logical qubit&rsquo;s integrity without triggering standard detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a comprehensive error pattern analysis would require an exhaustive computational approach beyond quick analytical estimation, revealing the complex probabilistic nature of quantum error correction.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity emerges as a nuanced function: <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \alpha p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span>, where the coefficient <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> quantifies specific two-error corruption pathways. Perfect fault tolerance implies <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha = 0\)</span>, while realistic scenarios suggest a second-order fidelity reduction.</p>
<p>The critical insight lies in post-selection criteria: we retain only outcomes where detected errors commute with the [[4,2,2]] code&rsquo;s stabilizer generators, fundamentally constraining potential state transformations.</p>
<p>Potential error patterns must simultaneously satisfy two stringent conditions: triggering zero ancilla measurements while preserving the logical <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> state. This suggests errors must be equivalent to stabilizer products, carefully avoiding logical operator interventions that would disrupt the quantum state&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>Logical Z errors pose no threat since <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> remains stable under such transformations. However, logical X errors would fundamentally alter the quantum information, potentially mapping the state to alternative logical configurations.</p>
<p>The critical investigation centers on identifying whether noise-induced error patterns can simultaneously evade detection and implement a logical X error - a determination that directly impacts the logical fidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L\)</span>.</p>
<p>While initially suspecting perfect fault tolerance, deeper analysis suggests a more nuanced scenario. Two-error interactions might strategically circumvent detection mechanisms, introducing a second-order fidelity reduction characterized by <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \alpha p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span>. Such subtle error correlations could compromise quantum information integrity, even within seemingly robust fault-tolerant architectures.</p>
<p>Determining the precise <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> coefficient requires exhaustive examination of potential two-error configurations, potentially involving systematic enumeration across a substantial pattern space of 2250 distinct error scenarios.</p>
<p>The logical X error pathways reveal complex transformation possibilities from the initial <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> state, with specific error combinations potentially inducing state transitions to <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_L\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_L\)</span>, or <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating whether the two-qubit error model can generate these logical X error patterns, focusing on the specific qubit interactions that might trigger state changes.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity appears to follow a nuanced error probability model, potentially capturing imperfect fault-tolerance through a quadratic error term with possible higher-order corrections.</p>
<p>I want to explore a concrete scenario involving specific error patterns. Consider an undetectable error sequence where <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_0\)</span> occurs after a CNOT gate, which might not immediately disrupt the logical state. This specific error configuration seems particularly intriguing because it could potentially bypass standard error detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>The circuit&rsquo;s fault-tolerant design aims to prepare a logical zero state, with post-selection on ancilla measurement playing a critical role in error suppression. However, the complexity of tracing error propagation through quantum gates makes precise analysis challenging.</p>
<p>My current understanding suggests that while single errors are likely manageable, two-error patterns present a more nuanced challenge. These patterns might potentially implement logical errors while remaining undetected, leading to a logical fidelity that scales quadratically with the error rate.</p>
<p>The mathematical form <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \alpha p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span> captures this quadratic error scaling, with <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> representing a key parameter that quantifies the resilience of the quantum error correction scheme.</p>
<p>The post-selection criteria involve two critical conditions: the ancilla measuring |0âŸ© and ensuring no detectable errors that disrupt the stabilizer code&rsquo;s logical state. This means carefully examining error patterns that can pass both verification tests.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity calculation becomes a ratio of probabilities, comparing successful logical state preservation against total acceptable error scenarios. The no-error case dominates the numerator, while the denominator accounts for all permissible error patterns.</p>
<p>The fundamental question remains whether all error patterns that pass the tests preserve the intended <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> logical state, which would maintain perfect fidelity.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis suggests a fidelity expression of <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \alpha p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span>, indicating potential second-order error corrections with a non-negative constant <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span>. The goal is determining whether perfect fault tolerance (<span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha = 0\)</span>) is achievable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring circuit structural insights that might reveal error suppression mechanisms. Specifically, I&rsquo;m investigating whether undetectable errors preserving the <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> logical state can be systematically characterized through stabilizer and logical Z operator interactions.</p>
<p>The complexity demands careful error pattern enumeration, which isn&rsquo;t feasible within current computational constraints. My current approach focuses on understanding how two-error sequences might implement logical X errors while circumventing detection syndromes.</p>
<p>The ancilla extraction circuit becomes crucial, with specific attention to how CNOT operations might propagate or isolate potential error mechanisms.</p>
<p>By tracking parity relationships between qubits 0 and 3, I can potentially map out error detection boundaries and understand syndrome measurement limitations.</p>
<p>Given the fault-tolerant circuit&rsquo;s constraints, I&rsquo;m developing an approximate logical fidelity model. The key parameters suggest a quadratic error suppression mechanism, where single errors are likely neutralized but two-error configurations might introduce logical errors.</p>
<p>My preliminary expectation is a logical fidelity expression of <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - c p^2\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> represents the number of two-error patterns capable of bypassing detection tests. An ideal scenario would eliminate these patterns, potentially achieving perfect fidelity.</p>
<p>However, the precise value of <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> requires comprehensive circuit analysis to definitively characterize potential error propagation pathways. I&rsquo;ll carefully complete the partial thought from the previous rewritten thinking and then summarize the new thinking.</p>
<p>c$ exactly. So my answer is: <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - c p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(c \geq 0\)</span> is a constant depending on error patterns and circuit structure.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a nuanced scenario where two-qubit Pauli errors could potentially corrupt the quantum state in unexpected ways. Some two-qubit Paulis might slip through undetected, passing the ancilla test while introducing subtle logical errors. This means the fidelity calculation needs careful consideration of these undetectable error mechanisms, potentially introducing first-order corrections to the error model. Single errors in a fault-tolerant circuit should not compromise the logical state after passing verification checks. This fundamentally defines fault tolerance, ensuring the system maintains integrity against initial error patterns.</p>
<p>The logical fidelity emerges as a quadratic correction, with potential small deviations represented by a constant <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span>. Specific error pair interactions might introduce subtle logical errors that circumvent initial detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>I anticipate the logical fidelity will follow the form <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - c p^2 + O(p^3)\)</span>, where perfect fault tolerance implies <span class="arithmatex">\(c = 0\)</span>. The ancilla-based error detection strategy suggests robustness against single and double error scenarios.</p>
<p>Exploring potential error symmetries could reveal deeper insights into the system&rsquo;s error-correction capabilities. Undetectable errors that preserve stabilizer relationships might not fundamentally alter the logical state, potentially simplifying the fidelity calculation.</p>
<p>Detailed error counting reveals complex interactions: ten possible two-CNOT error locations, with 225 potential error combinations per location. Not all combinations will pass ancilla tests or implement meaningful logical errors.</p>
<p>The proposed fidelity model suggests a quadratic error suppression mechanism, with a constant <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> capturing two-error pattern contributions. Determining whether <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> equals zero requires careful examination of error propagation through the quantum circuit.</p>
<p>Ancilla-checked qubits (0 and 3) provide partial error detection, while qubits 1 and 2 remain less directly monitored. This asymmetry hints at potential nuanced error dynamics within the fault-tolerant state preparation circuit.</p>
<p>An <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> error reveals intriguing commutation properties, potentially passing undetected through syndrome measurements. Its transformation involves complex logical operator relationships that challenge straightforward error classification.</p>
<p>The logical operators form rich equivalence classes, not simple single-term representations. Exploring how <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> relates to these classes requires careful algebraic manipulation and understanding of stabilizer group interactions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating whether this error can be decomposed into fundamental logical operators and stabilizers, which could illuminate its impact on quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>By systematically checking commutativity and algebraic relationships, I can trace its potential connections to established logical operator structures like <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_B\)</span>.</p>
<p>The current algebraic exploration suggests complex interrelationships between quantum error correction components, revealing intricate transformation pathways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered that <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> implements a specific logical operation mapping <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> through the logical operator <span class="arithmatex">\(\bar{X}_A \bar{X}_B\)</span>, which emerges from precise algebraic manipulations involving symmetry properties like <span class="arithmatex">\(S_1^2 = I\)</span>.</p>
<p>This single error is deeply problematic. It passes both code tests undetected - slipping through the ancilla verification and remaining invisible within the code&rsquo;s error detection mechanism. The consequence is critical: the logical qubit state becomes corrupted with a first-order fidelity correction of <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \beta p + O(p^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now investigating whether additional single errors might exhibit similar destructive characteristics after the CNOT operation, probing the circuit&rsquo;s fundamental vulnerability.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis reveals multiple undetectable error combinations: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1Z_2\)</span> each present unique transformation potentials that could potentially compromise the quantum information integrity.</p>
<p>After careful examination of <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span>, I&rsquo;ve determined it introduces a phase-based state corruption, transforming <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(-|11\rangle_L\)</span>. This suggests significant state manipulation beyond simple error detection.</p>
<p>The CNOT_12 operation exposes two critical undetectable error pathways, each occurring with a probability of <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span>. These errors fundamentally challenge the quantum error correction strategy.</p>
<p>I need a systematic approach to comprehensively map these error interactions across different CNOT configurations.</p>
<p>Analyzing XX errors across qubit pairs reveals no straightforward logical X implementations. Each pair&rsquo;s XX combination (<span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_2\)</span>, etc.) fails to produce a clean logical X operation, indicating complex error propagation dynamics.</p>
<p>Investigating ancilla test constraints, I find specific error patterns that preserve or disrupt the XOR measurement. Errors on qubit pairs (0,3) and (1,2) maintain the ancilla&rsquo;s zero state, suggesting these are potentially stable error configurations. Other qubit pair errors introduce detectable ancilla state changes, revealing intricate error detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>YY errors introduce additional complexity, potentially implementing logical X with concurrent logical Z transformations. ZZ errors remain fundamentally benign, only inducing logical Z modifications without disturbing the logical ground state.</p>
<p>Analyzing CNOT interactions, CNOT_12 emerges as uniquely vulnerable, representing the sole circuit operation where XX or YY errors can simultaneously pass the ancilla test and compromise the logical quantum state.</p>
<p>Single error probabilities contribute <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{2p}{15}\)</span> to state corruption, with the logical fidelity approximated as <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \frac{2p}{15} + O(p^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>I recognize potential nuances in error detection mechanisms that warrant deeper scrutiny, particularly around undetectable <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> errors passing ancilla verification.</p>
<p>Specific error scenarios emerge across different CNOT operations:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span> remain undetectable, producing distinct logical states
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1Z_2\)</span> preserves original logical state
- Certain qubit interactions like <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_0\)</span> trigger ancilla failures</p>
<p>These intricate error pathways suggest more complex fidelity calculations beyond initial linear approximations. Ancilla interactions reveal critical error detection challenges. Certain two-qubit errors can unexpectedly trigger ancilla measurement failures, compromising quantum error correction. Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_3X_4\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0X_4\)</span> type errors directly flip the ancilla, invalidating post-selection. The most significant error modes emerge after specific CNOT operations, particularly involving <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span> interactions, which collectively manifest with a <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{2p}{15}\)</span> probability of occurrence. I need to account for errors that pass both tests and result in <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span>, which include specific two-qubit errors after CNOT operations. These errors have probabilities proportional to <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>, specifically <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span> after CNOT_12.</p>
<p>Calculating the probabilities to first order in <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, I find the probability of <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> is <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5 + \frac{3p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>, while <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> has a probability of <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{2p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>. These calculations help me understand the error dynamics in the quantum error correction process.</p>
<p>By carefully analyzing the fidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L\)</span>, I derive an approximation that shows a slight degradation with error probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, specifically <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \frac{2p}{15} + O(p^2)\)</span>. This suggests a small but systematic reduction in quantum state preservation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now examining how CNOT operations involving the ancilla create entanglement and potentially introduce measurement complications. The key observation is that errors on the ancilla can fundamentally alter the post-measurement data state, making error analysis intricate.</p>
<p>My strategy shifts to isolating data qubit errors occurring after specific CNOT gates, recognizing that ancilla-related errors present a distinct challenge from pure data qubit perturbations. I&rsquo;ll methodically trace potential error pathways to understand their impact on quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>Focusing on CNOT_12, CNOT_10, and CNOT_23, I&rsquo;m mapping out which error types survive the quantum error correction tests. The critical insight emerges that only certain error combinations - specifically those preserving specific qubit correlations - can pass the stringent measurement criteria.</p>
<p>The mathematical representation suggests a first-order fidelity correction, with error probability scaling proportionally to the system&rsquo;s noise characteristics. My next step involves rigorously validating the ancilla measurement conditions for these error scenarios.</p>
<p>By systematically checking error propagation through each CNOT interaction, I&rsquo;m confirming the consistency of the error preservation mechanisms across different qubit interactions.</p>
<p>The preliminary fidelity estimate remains <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \frac{2p}{15} + O(p^2)\)</span>, pending further detailed verification of error pathways, particularly around the ancilla-involving CNOT operations.</p>
<p>Investigating the <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_3Z_4\)</span> error reveals nuanced state transformations. When applying this error, the quantum state maintains its fundamental structure but experiences a subtle phase modification, critically impacting ancilla measurement outcomes and subsequent state evolution.</p>
<p>Specifically, after CNOT_04, the state transformation demonstrates precise error propagation characteristics, with measurement of the ancilla yielding a definitive <span class="arithmatex">\(|00000\rangle\)</span> state under certain error conditions.</p>
<p>Analyzing potential error scenarios, I identify multiple error pathways that preserve the logical qubit state while maintaining quantum coherence. These include specific two-qubit errors like <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1Z_2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1Z_0\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_3Z_4\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_4\)</span>, each occurring with a probability of <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Combining these error probabilities yields a comprehensive error model: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5 + \frac{5p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>, capturing both no-error and specific two-qubit error scenarios that preserve quantum information integrity.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> states, I observe two primary error mechanisms: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2\)</span>, each contributing <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span> to the total error probability.</p>
<p>Calculating the logical fidelity reveals a nuanced error correction landscape, with <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L\)</span> approximating <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \frac{2p}{15}\)</span> to first order, indicating a slight degradation proportional to the error probability.</p>
<p>Seeking precision, I&rsquo;ll expand the terms to second order, carefully tracking the <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^4\)</span> expansions to capture more subtle error dynamics.</p>
<p>The numerator and denominator expansions will help me derive a more accurate representation of the logical fidelity, accounting for quadratic error contributions.</p>
<p>By applying the approximation <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{1+x} \approx 1 - x + x^2\)</span> for small <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span>, I can systematically break down the complex fraction into manageable components, revealing underlying mathematical structure.</p>
<p>I recognize the complexity is increasing, so I&rsquo;ll pivot to a more streamlined approach by defining <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L\)</span> as the ratio of numerator <span class="arithmatex">\(N\)</span> to denominator <span class="arithmatex">\(D\)</span>, which will simplify subsequent calculations.</p>
<p>To first order, I calculate the linear terms of both numerator and denominator. By carefully extracting the first-order coefficients, I derive <span class="arithmatex">\(N' = -\frac{14}{3}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(D' = -\frac{68}{15}\)</span>. </p>
<p>Combining these terms yields <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L \approx 1 - \frac{2}{15}\)</span>, a concise representation that captures the essential first-order behavior of the complex fraction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now cross-checking the calculation using an alternative approach involving probability terms for quantum error correction. By defining specific error probabilities <span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span>, I aim to validate the previous result through a different computational pathway.</p>
<p>My new method involves analyzing the probabilities of no error and single error scenarios, which will help confirm the earlier calculation&rsquo;s accuracy.</p>
<p>The algebraic manipulation reveals a systematic reduction of the fidelity expression, progressively simplifying the fraction by factoring out common terms and consolidating the error probability components.</p>
<p>The key transformation involves strategically canceling <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^4\)</span> terms and reorganizing the numerator and denominator to expose the underlying error probability structure.</p>
<p>The process culminates in expressing the logical qubit fidelity as a ratio that captures the nuanced relationship between error probabilities at different stages of quantum error correction.</p>
<p>By applying the first-order approximation technique, the expression converges to a linear function of the error probability, highlighting the initial error mitigation characteristics of the quantum protocol.</p>
<p>Carefully manipulating the algebraic terms reveals a systematic reduction in logical fidelity, with the leading correction term being <span class="arithmatex">\(-\frac{2p}{15}\)</span>. This indicates a slight degradation of the quantum state&rsquo;s reliability under single-error scenarios.</p>
<p>The calculation suggests the quantum circuit experiences imperfect fault tolerance, specifically noting potential state corruption following the CNOT_12 operation. The linear dependence on error probability provides insight into the circuit&rsquo;s error propagation mechanism.</p>
<p>The analysis leaves an open question about investigating second-order error terms, which could offer deeper understanding of the quantum error dynamics. I&rsquo;m carefully tracking error propagation through the quantum circuit, examining how specific error patterns affect the quantum state. By systematically analyzing each branch of the superposition, I can trace how <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> errors transform the initial state through successive CNOT gates. The detailed step-by-step calculation reveals critical insights into error dynamics, showing how each gate interaction modifies the quantum state&rsquo;s configuration.</p>
<p>The key observation emerges that error transformations aren&rsquo;t straightforward - they depend intrinsically on the sequence of quantum operations. My previous assumption about error commutativity was incorrect, highlighting the complex quantum mechanical interactions within the error correction circuit.</p>
<p>The analysis suggests a nuanced approach is necessary to understand how errors propagate and potentially compromise quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recognizing that fault-tolerance requires careful examination of error dynamics. Single errors must either be definitively detected or fundamentally unable to disrupt the logical quantum state.</p>
<p>The mathematical representation <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 + O(p^2)\)</span> implies a probabilistic threshold for error tolerance, but my detailed circuit analysis reveals potential inconsistencies that demand deeper investigation.</p>
<p>The critical insight involves understanding how errors interact with the quantum state preparation and ancilla coupling, which might fundamentally alter error propagation mechanisms.</p>
<p>My current calculations suggest potential discrepancies between theoretical fault-tolerance expectations and actual error behaviors, indicating a need to re-examine the underlying quantum circuit model and error assumptions.</p>
<p>The core challenge lies in understanding how single errors propagate and potentially corrupt quantum states, revealing nuanced interactions that deviate from simple logical operation models. My analysis points to a logical fidelity that differs from ideal fault-tolerant expectations, specifically showing <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \frac{2p}{15} + O(p^2)\)</span> instead of the expected <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 + O(p^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>I recognize multiple potential explanations: analytical errors, circuit-specific fault-tolerance limitations, or fundamental misunderstandings of the error propagation mechanism. The complexity demands careful, iterative investigation to resolve these uncertainties.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-identifying-undetectable-errors">Step 2: Identifying Undetectable Errors</h2>

<h2 id="step-5-determining-logical-states">Step 5: Determining Logical States</h2>
<p>Now I need to determine which logical state each error produces:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span>-type errors (<span class="arithmatex">\(Z_iZ_j\)</span>) implement logical Z operations, which don&rsquo;t change <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2 = \bar{X}_A\bar{X}_B\)</span> (changes <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span>)</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1Y_2 = -\bar{X}_A\bar{X}_B\bar{Z}_A\bar{Z}_B\)</span> (also gives <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span> with a phase)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-6-computing-the-fidelity">Step 6: Computing the Fidelity</h2>
<p>Errors that pass both tests and give <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_L\)</span>:
- No error: <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^5\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1Z_2\)</span> after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{12}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1Z_0\)</span> after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{10}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_3\)</span> after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{23}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_3Z_4\)</span> after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{34}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0Z_4\)</span> after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{04}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span></p>
<p>Errors that pass both tests and give <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_L\)</span>:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1X_2\)</span> after <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{12}\)</span>: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p}{15}(1-p)^4\)</span>

<p>The logical fidelity is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{(1-p)^5 + \frac{5p}{15}(1-p)^4}{(1-p)^5 + \frac{7p}{15}(1-p)^4}
\]</div>
<p>Simplifying:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{(1-p)^4[(1-p) + \frac{p}{3}]}{(1-p)^4[(1-p) + \frac{7p}{15}]} = \frac{1 - \frac{2p}{3}}{1 - \frac{8p}{15}}
\]</div>
<p>To first order in <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = (1 - \frac{2p}{3})(1 + \frac{8p}{15}) = 1 - \frac{2p}{3} + \frac{8p}{15} + O(p^2) = 1 - \frac{2p}{15} + O(p^2)
\]</div>
<p><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(F_L = 1 - \frac{2p}{15} + O(p^2)\)</span></p></div>

                        <p>The user wants me to fill in the code template with the final answer from Subproblem 3.</p>
<p>From my analysis, the logical fidelity is:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
F_L = \frac{1 - \frac{2p}{3}}{1 - \frac{8p}{15}}
\]</div>
<p>I need to express this as a SymPy expression.</p>
<p>In SymPy, this would be:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">F_logical</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let me double-check this expression:
- Numerator: <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \frac{2p}{3}\)</span>
- Denominator: <span class="arithmatex">\(1 - \frac{8p}{15}\)</span></p>
<p>Yes, this matches my derivation.</p>
