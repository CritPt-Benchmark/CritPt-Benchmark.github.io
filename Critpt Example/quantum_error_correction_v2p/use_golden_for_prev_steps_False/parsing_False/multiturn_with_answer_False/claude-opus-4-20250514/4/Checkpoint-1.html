    <div class="content markdown-body"><h1 id="problem-setup">Problem setup:</h1>
<p>In quantum error correction, you encode quantum states into logical states made of many qubits in order to improve their resilience to errors. In quantum error detection, you do the same but can only detect the presence of errors and not correct them. In this problem, we will consider a single [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code, which encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits, and investigate how robust logical quantum operations in this code are to quantum errors.</p>
<p>Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3. The two logical qubits are labelled A and B. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> are Pauli matrices. The logical <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.</p>
<p>We will consider different state preparation circuits consisting of controlled not <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gates, where <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> has control qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> and target qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>. As a simple model of quantum errors in hardware, we will suppose that each <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gate in the circuit has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. The probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> indicates the probability of an error in a single two-qubit gate. We will assess the logical infidelity of certain state preparation protocols as a function of the physical infidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="subproblem-1">Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>Suppose that we wish to prepare a logical two-qubit GHZ state  <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB}+|11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> in the [[4,2,2]] code. To do so, we use the following state preparation circuit:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
(CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2).
\]</div>
<p>Note that this equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while the quantum operations in the circuit occur in the reverse order (from right-to-left in the above equation). <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a single-qubit Hadamard gate.</p>
<p>What is the physical state fidelity of the final physical 4-qubit state at the end of the circuit as a function of the two-qubit gate error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>?</p></div>

                        <p>Let me understand this problem step by step.</p>
<p>We have a [[4,2,2]] quantum error correction code that encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits.</p>
<p>The stabilizers are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> 
- <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span></p>
<p>The logical operators are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B = XXII\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span></p>
<p>We want to prepare a logical two-qubit GHZ state: <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB} + |11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span></p>
<p>The state preparation circuit is:
<span class="arithmatex">\((CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2)\)</span></p>
<p>where operations occur from right to left.</p>
<p>Each CNOT gate has a two-qubit depolarizing error channel that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand what the logical states are:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> is the +1 eigenstate of both <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span> is the -1 eigenstate of both <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span></p>
<p>Let me find the logical computational basis states. The logical state <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> must satisfy:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A |00\rangle_{AB} = ZZII |00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B |00\rangle_{AB} = ZIZI |00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span></p>
<p>And it must be in the code space, so:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX |00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ |00\rangle_{AB} = |00\rangle_{AB}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating the code space&rsquo;s structure. The key requirement is finding states that are simultaneously +1 eigenstates of both stabilizers <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> stabilizer, I&rsquo;m focusing on basis states with an even number of 1&rsquo;s, starting with <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>. These states preserve the stabilizer&rsquo;s +1 eigenvalue.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> stabilizer introduces additional complexity, as it flips all four qubits. I need to determine which of these even-parity states remain unchanged under <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> transformation.</p>
<p>For a state to simultaneously satisfy <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> eigenstates, the bit configurations must maintain an even number of 1&rsquo;s when flipped. This means the original and its bit-flipped version must both have balanced parity.</p>
<p>The code space consists of four orthogonal states, each formed by symmetric superpositions of complementary bit strings. These states are constructed to ensure both <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> symmetry, with each vector representing a balanced configuration where the bit-flipped counterpart preserves the quantum properties.</p>
<p>The first basis vector <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_1\rangle\)</span> represents the simplest symmetric state connecting <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span>, demonstrating the fundamental symmetry principle of this quantum error correction code.</p>
<p>When applying the <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> operator on the first two qubits, <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_1\rangle\)</span> remains invariant, confirming its stability under this specific computational basis transformation. The eigenvalue behavior suggests this state maintains its quantum coherence under localized perturbations.</p>
<p>The subsequent computation for <span class="arithmatex">\(|v_2\rangle\)</span> reveals a sign change when <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> is applied, indicating a more complex interaction between the quantum state and the computational basis measurement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring the potential logical operators by considering their interactions with stabilizer generators. The key insight involves understanding how different operator combinations might transform the quantum state, particularly focusing on the interplay between <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operators across multiple qubits.</p>
<p>The multiplication of <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZII\)</span> with other stabilizer generators opens up intriguing possibilities for state manipulation, requiring careful tracking of phase and sign changes during these transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now investigating the specific qubit-level interactions, particularly the behavior when <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operators are applied sequentially, which introduces interesting quantum mechanical phase relationships.</p>
<p>The matrix representations of Pauli operators become crucial for precisely understanding these quantum state evolutions, highlighting the nuanced nature of quantum operator interactions.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(XY = iZ\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(YZ = iX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZX = iY\)</span> reveal intricate phase relationships between fundamental quantum gates. These relations suggest complex transformations when applying multiple operators.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on the [[4,2,2]] quantum error correction code, which encodes 2 logical qubits across 4 physical qubits. The circuit&rsquo;s initial state starts at <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>, and I&rsquo;m tracing how Hadamard gates will transform this quantum state.</p>
<p>The key observation is the need to carefully track phase factors and stabilizer equivalence when analyzing quantum circuits, as subtle transformations can significantly impact quantum information processing. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous thinking first:</p>

<p>Step 4 applies a CNOT gate with control qubit 0 and target qubit 3, transforming the quantum state. The operation flips the third qubit when the first qubit is in state |1âŸ©, resulting in a new superposition state. </p>
<p>The quantum circuit manipulates the qubits systematically, creating an entangled state with specific probability amplitudes. Each gate operation carefully modifies the quantum state, revealing the intricate quantum computation process.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll rewrite the next thinking:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m examining the code space properties by applying stabilizer operators. The XXXX operator returns the initial state, confirming one stabilizer condition. However, the ZZZZ operator reveals an interesting phase difference, suggesting the state isn&rsquo;t perfectly symmetric.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll analyze the parity of each basis state, tracking the number of |1âŸ© states to understand the quantum state&rsquo;s structure. The initial state shows subtle quantum interference patterns that deviate from a simple uniform superposition.</p>
<p>By checking the parity of each computational basis state, I confirm the logical GHZ state&rsquo;s consistency. The phase relationships between different basis states suggest a robust quantum error correction encoding.</p>
<p>Examining <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> reveals a symmetric transformation across basis states, with signs alternating predictably. The operator <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZII\)</span> generates a phase structure that preserves the state&rsquo;s fundamental symmetry.</p>

<p>The partial computation of the logical GHZ state&rsquo;s <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> action suggests a deeper algebraic structure underlying the quantum error correction code.</p>
<p>I need to carefully trace the eigenvalue assignments for each logical basis state, focusing on how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> interact with the quantum information encoding.</p>
<p>The basis states are systematically defined by their <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> eigenvalues:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> has +1 for both <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span> has +1 for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, -1 for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span> has -1 for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, +1 for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span> has -1 for both <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simplifying the notation by using <span class="arithmatex">\(|a\rangle, |b\rangle, |c\rangle, |d\rangle\)</span> to represent specific four-qubit states, with <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span> expressed as an equal superposition of these states.</p>
<p>The next step involves examining how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> transforms this ideal state, which requires careful tracking of the quantum operators&rsquo; actions. I&rsquo;ll systematically analyze the eigenstate properties of <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> across the four basis states. The operators <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> show interesting symmetry in their action on the computational basis states, with specific sign changes that reveal the underlying quantum code structure. </p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> (ZZII), the eigenvalues alternate between +1 and -1 for states with different qubit configurations. Similarly, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> (ZIZI) demonstrates a complementary pattern of eigenvalue assignments. These sign changes suggest a carefully constructed quantum error correction code where the basis states have precise relationships under these stabilizer operators.</p>
<p>The logical basis states reveal a symmetric <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span> superposition pattern, with each state representing a specific eigenvalue configuration for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>. The sign variations in these states indicate a sophisticated encoding mechanism that preserves quantum information while providing error detection and correction capabilities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring the code space&rsquo;s structural constraints, focusing on how the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> stabilizers define permissible quantum states. The key observation is the relationship between coefficients <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\gamma\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(\delta\)</span> that ensures the state remains invariant under these stabilizer transformations.</p>
<p>The emerging pattern suggests a carefully constructed quantum error correction code with precise symmetry requirements. The states must maintain specific coefficient relationships to remain within the code space&rsquo;s allowed subspace.</p>
<p>Specifically, the coefficients must mirror each other across bitwise complementary basis states, creating a symmetric representation that preserves the code&rsquo;s fundamental quantum properties.</p>
<p>The code space reveals a precise symmetry, with basis states paired in complementary configurations:

<p>The goal is to characterize eigenstates that simultaneously satisfy multiple stabilizer constraints across the quantum code space, methodically examining how different basis states interact with <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>By parameterizing the general state and applying <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators, I can systematically derive the constraints that define valid quantum code states, revealing the intricate quantum mechanical relationships between different computational basis representations.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals four distinct logical basis states, each corresponding to specific eigenvalue configurations for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> operators, which emerge from carefully eliminating coefficients that violate the stabilizer conditions.</p>
<p>These logical basis states represent fundamental quantum information encoding strategies, demonstrating how quantum error correction can leverage precise superposition and phase relationships to create robust computational states.</p>

<p>The circuit generates an ideal quantum state where specific bit configurations emerge through controlled quantum operations, revealing intricate quantum information processing dynamics.</p>
<p>However, the generated state diverges from the target GHZ state. The circuit&rsquo;s output doesn&rsquo;t match the desired quantum configuration, suggesting potential misalignment in logical state identification.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically investigate the logical operators to understand the underlying quantum transformation, carefully examining their interactions and potential computational nuances.</p>
<p>The logical operators <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> require precise verification to ensure their quantum mechanical consistency and potential state generation properties. I carefully compute the matrix multiplication for single-qubit gates, noting that <span class="arithmatex">\(XZ\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZX\)</span> have opposite signs, indicating they anti-commute. When extending to multi-qubit operators, I track the individual qubit transformations: <span class="arithmatex">\(XZ\)</span> on qubit 0, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> on qubit 1, <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> on qubit 2, and <span class="arithmatex">\(I\)</span> on qubit 3. This leads to the tensor product representation <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A Z_A = (XZ) \otimes Z \otimes X \otimes I\)</span>, highlighting the non-commutative nature of quantum operators.</p>
<p>The complementary calculation for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A X_A\)</span> reveals a symmetric anti-commutation relationship, confirming that <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> fundamentally do not commute. This property suggests deeper quantum mechanical interactions between different observables.</p>
<p>I anticipate similar anti-commutation patterns will emerge for other operator combinations across different qubit registers.</p>
<p>The circuit&rsquo;s actual output deviates from the intended GHZ state, producing <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB} + |10\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> instead of the canonical <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB} + |11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem requires computing physical state fidelity by comparing the actual state (with potential errors) against an ideal state. This ideal state is a specific superposition: <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1001\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span>.</p>

After applying the Hadamard gate on qubit 2, the state becomes a superposition with equal amplitudes for <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|0010\rangle\)</span>. </p>
<p>Following the CNOT gate between qubits 2 and 1, the state transforms to a superposition of <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span>. A two-qubit depolarizing error is then introduced, which probabilistically applies random Pauli operators to qubits 2 and 1, modifying the quantum state with a noise parameter <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll represent the initial state as <span class="arithmatex">\(|\phi\rangle\)</span>, which captures the quantum superposition after the CNOT operation. The error process involves a weighted sum of the original state and potential Pauli error transformations across the specified qubits.</p>
<p>The Pauli error terms demonstrate how different quantum gates can modify the state&rsquo;s amplitude and phase, introducing controlled randomness into the quantum computation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring the systematic way these error terms transform the quantum state, noting how each Pauli operator produces a distinct quantum configuration with specific probability amplitudes.</p>
<p>The complexity suggests I might need a more streamlined computational approach to track these quantum state transformations efficiently.</p>
<p>The depolarizing channel&rsquo;s fidelity formula reveals an interesting probabilistic structure. For a pure quantum state passing through this channel, the fidelity depends on both the original state&rsquo;s characteristics and the channel&rsquo;s noise parameter. Specifically, the formula captures how different Pauli operators contribute to state deviation, with most orthogonal projections canceling out.</p>

Then I apply the <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> gate, generating <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_4\)</span>. The final step introduces probabilistic Pauli errors on qubits 0 and 3, creating a mixed state <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_{final}\)</span> with a 15-state error distribution, excluding identity-only transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now exploring a more systematic representation of the quantum circuit&rsquo;s error dynamics.

<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on the fidelity calculation, which will quantify how closely the actual quantum state matches the ideal state. By expanding the final density matrix in terms of error probabilities, I can systematically characterize the quantum circuit&rsquo;s performance under noise.</p>
<p>The key observation is tracking the <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> no-error term and preparing to analyze the specific error contributions that deviate from the ideal quantum state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll trace how different quantum gates transform the state, carefully noting the state&rsquo;s evolution through each transformation and tracking potential error pathways.</p>
<p>The quantum state transitions through several key configurations, with each gate introducing potential probabilistic variations. By systematically mapping these transformations, I can analyze how quantum errors might propagate through the circuit&rsquo;s computational steps.</p>
<p>The first error scenario involves a specific probabilistic error distribution after the initial CNOT operation, where the state&rsquo;s fidelity is modulated by both the correct state probability and a distributed error term across possible perturbations.</p>

<p>For the specific case of errors after the second CNOT, I&rsquo;ll analyze how Pauli errors transform the ideal quantum state. By examining each potential error&rsquo;s effect on the initial state, I can systematically evaluate the quantum channel&rsquo;s performance under noise conditions.</p>
<p>The computational approach involves tracking how different Pauli errors map the initial state, calculating the overlap between transformed states, and quantifying the resulting fidelity metrics.</p>
<p>Most Pauli error transformations result in zero overlap with the original quantum state, indicating robust error suppression characteristics in this particular quantum circuit configuration.</p>
<p>Specifically, applying <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0\)</span> generates an orthogonal state vector, demonstrating the state&rsquo;s resilience against single-qubit bit-flip errors. Similarly, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0\)</span> transforms the state with a phase change that maintains orthogonality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating which single and two-qubit Pauli operations preserve the quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental symmetry, focusing on qubits 0 and 3 to understand potential error resilience mechanisms.</p>
<p>The state resides within the [[4,2,2]] quantum error correction code&rsquo;s code space. Most Pauli transformations will displace the state, except for specific stabilizer operations that maintain its intrinsic structural integrity.</p>
<p>Logical operators, while technically within the code&rsquo;s framework, would fundamentally alter the logical quantum information, rendering the fidelity effectively zero.</p>
<p>The stabilizers <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> do not exclusively target qubits 0 and 3. Consequently, no two-qubit Pauli operation on these specific qubits qualifies as a stabilizer, implying all 15 potential Pauli errors result in zero fidelity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of this straightforward conclusion and want to verify by examining specific quantum state overlaps. Initial computational checks of <span class="arithmatex">\(X_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_3\)</span> transformations suggest minimal state preservation, reinforcing the zero fidelity hypothesis.</p>
<p>However, a critical discovery emerges: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span> completely preserves the quantum state, yielding a fidelity of 1. This unexpected result challenges the initial blanket assumption about Pauli error impacts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll investigate which additional two-qubit Pauli operations on qubits 0 and 3 might exhibit similar state-preserving characteristics.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis reveals three potential candidates:
- Trivial identity operation <span class="arithmatex">\(I_0 I_3\)</span>
- Previously confirmed <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span>
- Potentially complex <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0 Y_3\)</span> transformation</p>
<p>Initial computations for <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0 Y_3\)</span> begin by examining its action on basis states, tracking how quantum amplitudes transform under this specific Pauli interaction.</p>
<p>Crucially, the operation can be rewritten using the fundamental relationship <span class="arithmatex">\(Y = iXZ\)</span>, which allows decomposing the transformation into more elementary quantum gates. This reveals an interesting symmetry where <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0 Y_3\)</span> reduces to <span class="arithmatex">\(-X_0 X_3 Z_0 Z_3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Subsequent investigation confirms interesting properties: <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span> preserves the ideal state, while <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0 Z_3\)</span> introduces a phase factor of <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculations demonstrate remarkable consistency, with <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0 Y_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0 Z_3\)</span> both yielding a perfect fidelity of 1, indicating robust quantum state preservation under these specific transformations.</p>
<p>Out of the 15 possible two-qubit Pauli operators on qubits 0 and 3, three specific operators (<span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_0 Y_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0 Z_3\)</span>) maintain state integrity, while the remaining 12 result in complete fidelity loss.</p>
<p>This leads to a calculated <span class="arithmatex">\(F_2\)</span> value of <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{5}\)</span>, derived from the weighted contribution of these operators.</p>
<p>The focus now shifts to computing <span class="arithmatex">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(F_3\)</span>, which requires carefully tracing error propagation through the quantum circuit&rsquo;s initial stages, beginning with analyzing the state transformation after the first CNOT gate.</p>
<p>Applying an <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1\)</span> error introduces specific state modifications, triggering a cascade of quantum state alterations through subsequent Hadamard and CNOT operations that fundamentally change the quantum information&rsquo;s trajectory.</p>
<p>The state becomes orthogonal to the ideal state, indicating zero fidelity. This suggests errors generically displace the quantum state from its intended code space configuration.</p>
<p>Rare exceptions might exist where errors map to alternative code states with potential state overlap. However, for small error probabilities, the primary infidelity contribution stems from errors that partially preserve quantum information structure.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis suggests errors on specific qubits (0 and 3) after the second CNOT yield an average fidelity of approximately 1/5, providing a simplified approximation for understanding quantum error dynamics. I&rsquo;ll compute the fidelity by systematically analyzing error propagation through the quantum circuit. The challenge involves tracking how different error scenarios on qubits 2 and 1 transform after the first CNOT gate, then propagating through subsequent gates to determine the final state&rsquo;s overlap with the ideal state.</p>
<p>The key is to methodically map out each possible error configuration and its impact on the quantum state&rsquo;s evolution. I&rsquo;ll need to carefully trace how each error transforms through the <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> gates, calculating the precise overlap for each scenario.</p>
<p>My approach will involve breaking down the complex multi-qubit error dynamics into manageable computational steps, examining how local errors on specific qubits can modify the overall quantum state&rsquo;s fidelity. I&rsquo;m tracking the complex quantum state evolution, focusing on error propagation through gate operations. The Pauli errors on specific qubits create intricate transformations that require careful computational analysis. </p>
<p>The fidelity calculation involves multiple error scenarios, with coefficients representing different probabilistic outcomes. Systematic exploration reveals the state&rsquo;s sensitivity to quantum noise, particularly after applying Hadamard and CNOT gates.</p>
<p>The mixed state representation captures the probabilistic nature of quantum errors, with <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho\)</span> encoding the ensemble of possible transformations across 15 distinct Pauli error configurations. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous thinking and then continue:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(X_1|\phi_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0100\rangle + |0010\rangle)\)</span>, transforming the initial state through Pauli X operation. </p>
<p>Applying Hadamard and CNOT gates reveals a complex state transformation, expanding the quantum state across multiple basis configurations. The computation involves intricate quantum operations that systematically modify the quantum register&rsquo;s amplitudes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll track how these transformations impact the quantum state&rsquo;s overlap with the ideal target state, carefully examining each quantum gate&rsquo;s effect on the system&rsquo;s coherence and probability distributions.</p>
<p>The zero overlap suggests critical insights about quantum error propagation and code space preservation. Errors on specific qubits fundamentally disrupt the quantum information encoding, potentially eliminating the state&rsquo;s alignment with the intended quantum configuration.</p>
<p>This systematic exploration reveals how localized quantum errors can catastrophically degrade quantum information integrity, highlighting the delicate nature of quantum error correction strategies.</p>
<p>The key observation centers on how errors, particularly on qubits 2 and 1, generically eject the quantum state from its carefully constructed code space, rendering subsequent quantum operations ineffective.</p>
<p>However, a nuanced examination reveals intriguing symmetries. Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1\)</span> exhibit identical phase-flipping behavior on the initial state, suggesting deeper structural equivalences in the quantum error correction framework.</p>
<p>This symmetry implies potential degeneracies in error propagation, hinting at more complex quantum dynamics than initially anticipated. The state&rsquo;s inherent structure allows certain errors to interact in surprisingly uniform ways.</p>
<p>Focusing on qubits 1 and 2, I observe multiple error transformations:
- Identity operation preserves state
- Single-qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> gates induce controlled bit flips
- Composite <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> operations generate more complex state transitions</p>
<p>These observations point toward fundamental symmetries in quantum error interactions.</p>
<p>For the specific state <span class="arithmatex">\(|\phi_1\rangle\)</span>, I notice intriguing transformations:
- Some error operations produce equivalent quantum states
- Certain error combinations return the original state
- Symmetries emerge in how quantum errors propagate</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m systematically exploring the complete set of potential error scenarios across the quantum system.</p>
<p>The first few error operations reveal fascinating quantum dynamics:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(X_1\)</span> shifts the state to <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0100\rangle + |0010\rangle)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1\)</span> introduces a phase shift, transforming the state with an imaginary coefficient</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1\)</span> dramatically alters the state&rsquo;s sign structure</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(X_2\)</span> demonstrates similar behavior to <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Y_2\)</span> shows an interesting sign-flipping relationship with <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking how each quantum error operation uniquely modifies the quantum state&rsquo;s configuration.</p>
<p>The subsequent operations reveal intricate interactions:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2\)</span> mirrors <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1\)</span>&rsquo;s transformation</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(X_1 X_2\)</span> preserves the initial state</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(X_1 Y_2\)</span> triggers a complex phase and sign manipulation</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(X_1 Z_2\)</span> generates another state transformation</li>
</ol>
<p>These quantum error operations demonstrate sophisticated state manipulation techniques.</p>
<p>A rough fidelity estimate suggests approximately 0.1, though precise calculation requires comprehensive case analysis. The complexity suggests systematic computational exploration might yield more definitive insights.</p>
<p>The problem demands careful, methodical examination of quantum state interactions, potentially revealing underlying symmetries or computational shortcuts.</p>
<p>The [[4,2,2]] CSS code presents interesting computational basis state transformations under Pauli errors, with computational basis states mapping predictably yet intricately.</p>
<p>Preliminary findings indicate the ideal quantum state involves a specific superposition, with error probabilities varying across different circuit stages. The complexity suggests nuanced error propagation mechanisms that require detailed computational investigation.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculation involves multiple error scenarios, tracking how two-qubit gate error rates impact the final quantum state&rsquo;s physical characteristics. Explicit computation appears necessary to fully characterize the system&rsquo;s error dynamics.</p>
<p>I notice some symmetries in the Pauli error transformations that suggest not all 15 error cases will produce unique states. Specifically, certain Pauli operations on adjacent qubits produce equivalent transformations, which could simplify the computational complexity.</p>
<p>The state after errors seems to have interesting structural properties, with specific Pauli operations exhibiting equivalent effects that reduce the total number of distinct error configurations.</p>
<p>By systematically tracking these state transformations, I can see a path to reducing the computational overhead of tracking each potential error scenario. The key is recognizing the symmetries and equivalence classes among the Pauli error operations.</p>
<p>The full analysis would require carefully mapping each potential error&rsquo;s impact on the quantum state, tracking how different Pauli operations modify the initial state&rsquo;s amplitudes and phases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to methodically enumerate the error propagation through the quantum gates, computing the overlap with the ideal state for each error configuration. This involves tracking how <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> gates transform the error-induced states.</p>
<p>The final fidelity calculation will synthesize these individual error contributions into a probabilistic model, weighting each error scenario by its likelihood of occurrence.</p>
<p>The quantum circuit&rsquo;s evolution shows a systematic progression:
- Initial superposition state emerges after <span class="arithmatex">\(H_2\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span> entangles specific qubits
- Pauli errors probabilistically perturb the quantum state
- Subsequent gates like <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> propagate these errors</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully track how each error transforms the quantum state, ensuring comprehensive error characterization.</p>
<p>The density matrix captures multiple error scenarios:
- Ideal state preservation
- Single Pauli error contributions
- Cross-error interactions
- Compounded error probabilities</p>
<p>The mathematical structure suggests a nuanced error modeling approach, tracking quantum state transformations under probabilistic perturbations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll compute the fidelity by analyzing the inner product terms, noting the systematic decomposition of error contributions across different quantum operations.</p>
<p>The key observation is the weighted sum of error probabilities, where each term represents a specific quantum error mechanism, carefully quantified by the probability parameter p.</p>
<p>I need to explicitly calculate <span class="arithmatex">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(F_3\)</span> to understand the precise fidelity landscape, which will reveal how quantum noise impacts the ideal quantum state&rsquo;s preservation.</p>
<p>The partial computation suggests a structured approach to tracking quantum state infidelity across different Pauli error scenarios.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(F_3\)</span>, I&rsquo;ve discovered a critical insight: the average fidelity depends on the state&rsquo;s relationship to the ideal quantum state. States either completely disconnect from the code space, yielding zero fidelity, or maintain a minimal connection, resulting in a <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{5}\)</span> fidelity value.</p>
<p>This nuanced breakdown provides a clear mechanism for understanding how quantum errors probabilistically transform quantum information.</p>
<p>I want to explore which specific errors on qubits 2 and 1 preserve the fundamental quantum state structure. By examining how different Pauli operations interact with the initial state <span class="arithmatex">\(|\phi_1\rangle\)</span>, I can identify transformations that maintain state proportionality.</p>
<p>The key constraint is finding Pauli operations that leave <span class="arithmatex">\(|\phi_1\rangle\)</span> invariant up to a phase. I&rsquo;ve already confirmed <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1 X_2\)</span> satisfies this condition, and I&rsquo;m now investigating whether other Pauli combinations might similarly preserve the state&rsquo;s essential quantum characteristics.</p>
<p>Analyzing <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1 Y_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1 Z_2\)</span> reveals they also maintain state invariance. Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(Y_1 Y_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_1 Z_2\)</span> generate transformations that return the state to its original configuration, suggesting these represent valid quantum error scenarios.</p>
<p>Counting the viable error types, I&rsquo;ve identified three distinct Pauli operations out of a possible fifteen that preserve the quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental structure.</p>
<p>Calculating the probabilities, I derive <span class="arithmatex">\(F_1\)</span> as <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{5}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(F_3\)</span> as <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{25}\)</span>. The final error probability function <span class="arithmatex">\(F(p)\)</span> emerges as a quadratic expression combining state preservation probabilities and error transition likelihoods.</p>
<p>The derived formula <span class="arithmatex">\(F(p) = (1-p)^2 + \frac{2(1-p)p}{5} + \frac{p^2}{25}\)</span> captures the quantum system&rsquo;s error dynamics across different probability scenarios.</p>
<p>Expanding the expression reveals intricate interactions between error rates, showing how system reliability depends on transition probabilities. Each term represents a specific error propagation pathway, highlighting the complexity of quantum error correction mechanisms.</p>
<p>The final fidelity equation captures the nuanced relationship between probability and system performance, demonstrating how small probability shifts dramatically influence overall quantum state preservation.</p>
