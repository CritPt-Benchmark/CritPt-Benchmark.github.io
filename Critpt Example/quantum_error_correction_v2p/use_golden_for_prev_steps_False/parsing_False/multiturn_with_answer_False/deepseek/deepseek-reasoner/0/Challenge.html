    <div class="content markdown-body"><h1 id="problem-setup">Problem setup:</h1>
<p>In quantum error correction, you encode quantum states into logical states made of many qubits in order to improve their resilience to errors. In quantum error detection, you do the same but can only detect the presence of errors and not correct them. In this problem, we will consider a single [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code, which encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits, and investigate how robust logical quantum operations in this code are to quantum errors.</p>
<p>Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3. The two logical qubits are labelled A and B. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> are Pauli matrices. The logical <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.</p>
<p>We will consider different state preparation circuits consisting of controlled not <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gates, where <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> has control qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> and target qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>. As a simple model of quantum errors in hardware, we will suppose that each <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gate in the circuit has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. The probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> indicates the probability of an error in a single two-qubit gate. We will assess the logical infidelity of certain state preparation protocols as a function of the physical infidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="main-problem">Challenge</h1>
<p>Suppose that we prepare a logical two-qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> state in the [[4,2,2]] code. To do so, we introduce an ancilla qubit, qubit 4, and use the following state preparation circuit:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
M_4 (CNOT_{04}) (CNOT_{34}) (CNOT_{23}) (CNOT_{10}) (CNOT_{12}) (H_1)
\]</div>
<p>Note that this equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while the quantum operations in the circuit occur in the reverse order (from right-to-left in the above equation).  <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a single-qubit Hadamard gate and <span class="arithmatex">\(M\)</span> is a single-qubit measurement. The ancilla is used to detect errors in the state preparation circuit and makes the circuit fault-tolerant. If the ancilla measurement is <span class="arithmatex">\(|0\rangle\)</span> (<span class="arithmatex">\(|1\rangle\)</span>), the state preparation succeeds (fails).</p>
<p>What is the logical state fidelity of the final 2-qubit logical state at the end of the circuit as a function of two-qubit gate error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, assuming the state is post-selected on all detectable errors in the code and on the ancilla qubit measuring <span class="arithmatex">\(|0\rangle\)</span>?</p></div>

                      <div class="markdown-body reasoning-body">
                        <p>We are given: &ldquo;What is the logical state fidelity of the final 2-qubit logical state at the end of the circuit as a function of two-qubit gate error rate p, assuming the state is post-selected on all detectable errors in the code and on the ancilla qubit measuring |0⟩?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interpretation: We have a circuit that prepares the logical state |00&gt;<em>{AB}. The circuit is:
M_4 (CNOT</em>{04}) (CNOT_{34}) (CNOT_{23}) (CNOT_{10}) (CNOT_{12}) (H_1)</p>
<p>But careful: The equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while quantum operations occur in reverse order. So the actual circuit order from initial state to final state is:
Start: Possibly initial state? Usually, we start with all qubits in |0&gt;? But then we have H_1. So initial state: qubits 0,1,2,3,4? Possibly qubits 0,1,2,3 are the code qubits, and qubit 4 is ancilla. They are all initially in |0&gt;? Typically yes.
Then the operations are applied in the order from right to left:
Step 1: H_1
Step 2: CNOT_{12}
Step 3: CNOT_{10}
Step 4: CNOT_{23}
Step 5: CNOT_{34}
Step 6: CNOT_{04}
Step 7: M_4 (measurement on qubit 4)</p>
<p>And then we post-select on measurement outcome 0.</p>
<p>We assume that each CNOT gate is followed by a two-qubit depolarizing error channel. That error channel: With probability p, an error occurs. And if an error occurs, it is uniformly one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis. So each CNOT gate: after it, with probability (1-p) no error, and with probability p, an error from the set {I,X,Y,Z}⊗{I,X,Y,Z} minus identity, each with probability p/15.</p>
<p>We want: &ldquo;logical state fidelity&rdquo; of the final 2-qubit logical state. That is: fidelity between the actual state (after post-selection on ancilla measurement 0 and on detectable errors? Actually: &ldquo;assuming the state is post-selected on all detectable errors in the code and on the ancilla qubit measuring |0⟩&rdquo;. That means we only consider cases where the state is error-free according to the code&rsquo;s error detection? But wait: The code is [[4,2,2]]. Its stabilizers are XXXX and ZZZZ. So detectable errors are those that anticommute with at least one stabilizer. So if an error occurs that is detectable, then we discard the state. So we only keep states that are either no error or undetectable errors? But careful: &ldquo;post-selected on all detectable errors&rdquo; might mean that if an error is detectable, we discard it. So we only accept states that are either error-free or have errors that commute with both stabilizers? But then such errors might be logical errors. So then the fidelity is the probability that the state is exactly the desired logical state |00&gt;_{AB}? But then &ldquo;logical state fidelity&rdquo; is defined as the overlap with the ideal state. But since we are post-selecting on no detectable errors, the state might still have undetectable errors. Those are logical errors. So the fidelity is the probability that no logical error occurred.</p>
<p>Alternatively: &ldquo;logical state fidelity&rdquo; might be the probability that the state is exactly the intended logical state. That is: F = probability(no error that changes the logical state) given that the state passed post-selection (ancilla measurement 0 and no detectable error from code checks). But careful: The circuit itself might introduce errors. And we are considering that each CNOT gate has an error channel. So we need to compute the overall effect: The ideal circuit (without errors) produces the state |00&gt;_{AB} (and ancilla in 0). With errors, some gates might introduce Pauli errors. These Pauli errors propagate through the circuit. We want to know: Given that the final state (after measurement of ancilla gives 0 and after we check the stabilizers and they are +1) what is the probability that the logical state is still |00&gt;? That probability is the fidelity.</p>
<p>So approach: List all CNOT gates: There are 5 CNOT gates: CNOT_{12}, CNOT_{10}, CNOT_{23}, CNOT_{34}, CNOT_{04}. Each gate is followed by an error. The errors are Pauli operators on the two qubits involved. They occur with probability p/15 each for each of the 15 non-identity Paulis. And no error with probability 1-p.</p>
<p>We want to compute the overall effect on the logical state. Since errors are Pauli, and the circuit is Clifford, we can track how each error propagates through the subsequent gates. The final state will be some Pauli error on the 5 qubits? But note: The ancilla qubit is measured. And we post-select on measurement outcome 0. That measurement might detect some errors. Also, the code&rsquo;s stabilizers are checked? &ldquo;Post-selected on all detectable errors in the code&rdquo; means that if the state has an error that is detectable (i.e., it anticommutes with at least one stabilizer), then we discard it. So we only keep states that are in the code space? Actually, careful: The code is [[4,2,2]]. Its stabilizers are XXXX and ZZZZ. So the code space is the +1 eigenspace of both. So if an error occurs that anticommutes with either stabilizer, then when we measure the stabilizers, we get -1. So we discard those. So we only keep states that are in the code space. But wait: There might be errors that are not in the code space but still give ancilla measurement 0? But then we also post-select on code detectable errors? So overall, we only accept if: (1) The ancilla measurement is 0. (2) The state is in the code space (i.e., stabilizers measure +1). So then the state is a logical state. And we want the fidelity of that logical state relative to |00&gt;_{AB}. That fidelity will be the probability that the logical error is identity.</p>
<p>So we need to compute: For each combination of errors on the 5 CNOT gates (each error is either I or one of the 15 Paulis on the two qubits of that gate), what is the overall Pauli error on the 4 data qubits (and possibly on ancilla? But ancilla is measured, so its state is projected. But careful: The errors occur after each CNOT. They are applied to the state. Then subsequent gates are applied. So we can propagate each error through the circuit. At the end, we get a Pauli operator on qubits 0,1,2,3,4. Then we condition on: The measurement on qubit 4 gives 0. That means that the Pauli error on qubit 4 must be such that it does not flip the measurement outcome? Actually, careful: The measurement is in the Z basis. So if the error on qubit 4 is a Pauli that anticommutes with Z (i.e., X or Y), then it might flip the measurement outcome. But since we post-select on measurement 0, that means that the error must be such that the state is an eigenstate of Z on qubit 4 with eigenvalue +1? Actually, if there is an error that is a Pauli on qubit 4 that is not identity? But wait: The circuit itself: The ideal circuit produces ancilla in |0&gt;. So if an error occurs that is, say, X on qubit 4, then the state becomes |1&gt; on ancilla. But then measurement would yield 1. So we discard those. So condition: The overall error on qubit 4 must be such that it does not flip the state from |0&gt; to |1&gt;. But careful: The error might be applied at different times. But since we are considering Pauli errors, we can propagate them to the end. At the end, the ideal state is |ψ_ideal&gt; on data and |0&gt; on ancilla. An error E (Pauli on all qubits) will yield E|ψ_ideal&gt;|0&gt;. For the measurement on ancilla to be 0, we need that the ancilla part of E acting on |0&gt; gives |0&gt; up to a phase. That means that the Pauli on qubit 4 must be either I or Z. Because X|0&gt; = |1&gt;, Y|0&gt; = i|1&gt;? Actually, Y|0&gt; = i|1&gt; so that also gives |1&gt; up to phase? But careful: The measurement is projective in the Z basis. So if the state is |1&gt;, it gives outcome 1. So we want the state to be in the span of |0&gt;. So indeed, the Pauli on qubit 4 must be either I or Z. But wait: Could it be that the error is such that it flips the ancilla but then later gates correct it? But since errors are Pauli and circuit is Clifford, the overall effect is a Pauli. So condition: The final Pauli on qubit 4 must commute with Z? Actually, we want: The state E|ψ_ideal&gt;|0&gt; is an eigenstate of Z_4 with eigenvalue +1. That means that the Pauli on qubit 4 must be either I or Z. Because if it is X or Y, then X|0&gt; = |1&gt;, so eigenvalue -1. So condition: The Pauli on qubit 4 (from the overall error) should be I or Z.</p>
<p>Also, we post-select on code detectable errors: That means that the error on the data qubits (0,1,2,3) must be in the stabilizer of the code? Actually, the code space is the +1 eigenspace of XXXX and ZZZZ. An error E on data is detectable if it anticommutes with at least one stabilizer. So if E anticommutes with XXXX or ZZZZ, then when we measure these stabilizers, we get -1 and we discard. So we only keep if E commutes with both XXXX and ZZZZ. That means E is in the normalizer of the stabilizer group. But note: The normalizer includes the stabilizers themselves and the logical operators. So the errors that are not detected are those that are either in the stabilizer group (which act trivially on the code space) or are logical operators (which change the logical state). So condition: The error on data must commute with XXXX and ZZZZ. That is equivalent to: The error is a product of stabilizers and logical operators. But careful: There is also the possibility of errors that are not in the normalizer? Those are detected. So we discard them.</p>
<p>So overall, we want to compute: The probability that given a set of errors on the 5 CNOT gates (each with probability distribution: with probability 1-p, no error; with probability p/15, each of the 15 Paulis on that gate&rsquo;s qubits), the overall propagated error on the data qubits and ancilla qubit at the end is such that:
(1) The ancilla part is I or Z (so that measurement gives 0).
(2) The data error commutes with both stabilizers (so that it is undetectable).
And then among those, we want the probability that the logical error is identity (i.e., the error on data is actually a stabilizer element, not a logical operator). That probability is the fidelity.</p>
<p>But wait: &ldquo;logical state fidelity&rdquo; might be the overlap squared. But since we are dealing with Pauli errors, if the error is a logical operator, then the state is orthogonal to the ideal state. So fidelity = probability that the error is trivial (up to stabilizers) on the code space.</p>
<p>So we need to compute: For each CNOT gate, there is an error channel. We want to sum over all combinations of errors on the 5 gates that lead to a final error that satisfies the post-selection conditions, and then among those, the fraction that yield no logical error. But careful: The errors are independent. So we can compute the total probability of success (post-selection) and the probability of success with no logical error. Then the fidelity is (probability no logical error) / (probability post-selection)? But the problem statement: &ldquo;What is the logical state fidelity of the final 2-qubit logical state &hellip; assuming the state is post-selected on all detectable errors and on the ancilla qubit measuring |0⟩?&rdquo; That suggests that we only consider the cases that pass post-selection. And then the fidelity is the probability that the state is indeed |00&gt;_{AB} given that it passed. So that is: F = (Probability that error is trivial and conditions are met) / (Probability that conditions are met).</p>
<p>But maybe we can compute this to first order in p? Because p is small. The problem likely expects an expression in terms of p. Possibly the answer is something like: F = 1 - a p + &hellip; But wait: The circuit has 5 CNOT gates. Each gate has error probability p. So the probability of no error at all is (1-p)^5. But then there might be errors that are exactly stabilizers? Those would still yield the correct state. Also errors that are logical? Those yield wrong state. And errors that are detectable? Those are discarded. So we want to compute the leading order correction to fidelity. Possibly the answer is: F = 1 - (number of logical error patterns)* (p/15)? But careful: There might be cancellations? Also, errors on different gates might combine to give a stabilizer. So we need to compute the propagation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s denote the gates in order of application:
Gates: </p>
<ol>
<li>H_1</li>
<li>CNOT_{12}</li>
<li>CNOT_{10}</li>
<li>CNOT_{23}</li>
<li>CNOT_{34}</li>
<li>CNOT_{04}</li>
<li>Measure qubit 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>We start with all qubits in |0&gt;. So initial state: |0&gt;^5.
Ideal circuit: 
H_1 on qubit 1: becomes |+&gt; on qubit 1.
Then CNOT_{12}: That does: control qubit 1, target qubit 2. So qubit 2 becomes XOR with qubit 1.
Then CNOT_{10}: control qubit 1, target qubit 0.
Then CNOT_{23}: control qubit 2, target qubit 3.
Then CNOT_{34}: control qubit 3, target qubit 4.
Then CNOT_{04}: control qubit 0, target qubit 4.
Then measure qubit 4. Ideally, it should be 0.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compute the ideal state step by step:
Qubits: 0,1,2,3,4.
Initial: |0&gt;|0&gt;|0&gt;|0&gt;|0&gt;.
After H_1: |0&gt; (H|0&gt; = |+&gt;) on qubit 1, so state: |0&gt;<em>0 |+&gt;_1 |0&gt;_2 |0&gt;_3 |0&gt;_4.
After CNOT</em>{12}: Control qubit 1, target qubit 2. So if qubit 1 is |+&gt;, then CNOT gives: |0&gt;|+&gt;|+&gt;? Actually, careful: CNOT_{12} on |0&gt;|+&gt;|0&gt; gives: For qubit 1: |+&gt; = (|0&gt;+|1&gt;)/√2, so then qubit 2 becomes: if control=0 then unchanged, if control=1 then flip. So state becomes: |0&gt;<em>0 (|0&gt;|0&gt; + |1&gt;|1&gt;)/√2 on qubits 1 and 2, and others: |0&gt;_3,|0&gt;_4. So state: |0&gt;_0 (|00&gt;+|11&gt;)/√2 on qubits 1,2; |0&gt;_3; |0&gt;_4.
After CNOT</em>{10}: Control qubit 1, target qubit 0. So now qubits 0 and 1: Initially: qubit 0 is |0&gt;, qubit 1 is in superposition. So CNOT_{10}: if qubit 1=0, then qubit 0 stays; if qubit 1=1, then qubit 0 flips. So state becomes: (|0&gt;|0&gt;|0&gt; + |1&gt;|1&gt;|1&gt;)/√2 on qubits 0,1,2? Actually careful: The state is: qubit 0,1,2: from previous: (|0&gt;<em>0|00&gt;</em>{12} + |0&gt;<em>0|11&gt;</em>{12})/√2? Actually, after CNOT_{12}, we had: |0&gt;<em>0 ⊗ (|00&gt;</em>{12} + |11&gt;<em>{12})/√2. Then CNOT</em>{10} acts on qubits 1 and 0. So on the term |0&gt;<em>0|00&gt;</em>{12}, qubit 1=0 so qubit 0 remains |0&gt;. On the term |0&gt;<em>0|11&gt;</em>{12}, qubit 1=1 so qubit 0 becomes |1&gt;. So state becomes: (|0&gt;<em>0|00&gt;</em>{12} + |1&gt;<em>0|11&gt;</em>{12})/√2. So state: (|000&gt; + |111&gt;)/√2 on qubits 0,1,2? But careful: That is on qubits 0,1,2. And qubits 3,4 are still |0&gt;.
So state: |ψ&gt; = (|000&gt;<em>{0,1,2} + |111&gt;</em>{0,1,2})/√2 ⊗ |0&gt;<em>3 ⊗ |0&gt;_4.
After CNOT</em>{23}: Control qubit 2, target qubit 3. So on the term |000&gt;<em>{0,1,2}, qubit 2=0 so qubit 3 stays 0. On |111&gt;</em>{0,1,2}, qubit 2=1 so qubit 3 flips to 1. So state becomes: (|0000&gt;<em>{0,1,2,3} + |1111&gt;</em>{0,1,2,3})/√2 ⊗ |0&gt;<em>4.
After CNOT</em>{34}: Control qubit 3, target qubit 4. On first term: qubit 3=0 so qubit 4 stays 0. On second: qubit 3=1 so qubit 4 flips to 1. So state becomes: (|0000&gt;<em>{0,1,2,3}|0&gt;_4 + |1111&gt;</em>{0,1,2,3}|1&gt;<em>4)/√2.
After CNOT</em>{04}: Control qubit 0, target qubit 4. On first term: qubit 0=0 so qubit 4 stays 0. On second: qubit 0=1 so qubit 4 flips from 1 to 0. So state becomes: (|0000&gt;|0&gt; + |1111&gt;|0&gt;)/√2 = (|0000&gt; + |1111&gt;)/√2 ⊗ |0&gt;_4.
So the final state on data qubits is (|0000&gt; + |1111&gt;)/√2. And that is indeed the logical |00&gt; state for the [[4,2,2]] code? Check: The logical states: Usually, |00&gt;_L = (|0000&gt;+|1111&gt;)/√2, |01&gt;_L = (|0011&gt;+|1100&gt;)/√2, etc. So yes.</p>
<p>So ideal circuit produces |00&gt;_L on data and |0&gt; on ancilla.</p>
<p>Now, we introduce errors after each CNOT gate. There are 5 CNOT gates. Let&rsquo;s label them:
Gate 1: CNOT_{12}
Gate 2: CNOT_{10}
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}</p>
<p>And also there is H_1 at the beginning, but no error on H? Only CNOT gates have errors.</p>
<p>We assume that after each CNOT, an error occurs on the two qubits involved. That error is a Pauli from {I, X, Y, Z}⊗{I, X, Y, Z} minus identity? Actually: &ldquo;each CNOT_{ij} gate has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability p/15.&rdquo; So for each gate, the error operator E is on qubits i and j. It can be written as P_i Q_j where P,Q ∈ {X,Y,Z} but not both I. But careful: There are 15 possibilities: They are: X⊗I, Y⊗I, Z⊗I, I⊗X, I⊗Y, I⊗Z, X⊗X, X⊗Y, X⊗Z, Y⊗X, Y⊗Y, Y⊗Z, Z⊗X, Z⊗Y, Z⊗Z.
And probability: p/15 each, and probability (1-p) for no error.</p>
<p>We want to compute the overall effect of these errors. Since they are Pauli errors and the circuit is Clifford, we can propagate each error through the subsequent gates. The overall effect will be a Pauli operator on the 5 qubits at the end. That Pauli operator is the product of the propagated errors from each gate. But careful: The order: The errors occur after each gate. So if an error occurs after gate k, then it will be acted on by all gates after gate k. So we can compute: Let E_k be the error on the gate k (on the qubits that gate acts on). Then the overall error at the end is: U_total * (E_5 * E_4 * E_3 * E_2 * E_1) * U_total^\dagger? Actually, careful: The circuit is U = U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1, where U_1 = CNOT_{12}, U_2 = CNOT_{10}, U_3 = CNOT_{23}, U_4 = CNOT_{34}, U_5 = CNOT_{04}. And errors: After U_1, we apply error E1 on qubits (1,2). Then after U_2, error E2 on qubits (1,0). Then after U_3, error E3 on qubits (2,3). Then after U_4, error E4 on qubits (3,4). Then after U_5, error E5 on qubits (0,4).
So the actual evolution is: U_5 * (E5) * U_4 * (E4) * U_3 * (E3) * U_2 * (E2) * U_1 * (E1) * (initial state). But since initial state is |0&gt;^5, and ideal circuit gives |ψ_ideal&gt;|0&gt;_4. The effect of errors can be computed by moving them to the end using the conjugation by the subsequent gates. That is: U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1 = (U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger U_5^\dagger E5 U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * &hellip; Actually, more systematically: Write the overall operator as: U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1 = U_total * (U_total^\dagger U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1). But careful: U_total = U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1. Then we have: U_total^\dagger U_5 = U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger. So then product becomes: U_total * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger E4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger E3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger E2 U_1) * E1.
So if we define: 
E1&rsquo; = E1 (on qubits 1,2) but then conjugated by U_1? Actually, careful: The order: The errors appear as: 
A = U_1^\dagger E2 U_1, 
B = U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger E3 U_2 U_1,
C = U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger E4 U_3 U_2 U_1,
D = U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1,
and then E1 remains as is.
So overall, the error at the end is: E_total = D * C * B * A * E1? But careful: The order of multiplication: The actual operator is U_total * (D C B A E1). And since U_total is the ideal circuit, the state becomes E_total applied to the ideal state. So indeed, the overall error operator on the final state (on qubits 0,1,2,3,4) is E_total = (conjugation of E5 by U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (conjugation of E4 by U_3 U_2 U_1) * (conjugation of E3 by U_2 U_1) * (conjugation of E2 by U_1) * (E1). But note: The conjugations are by Clifford gates, so they map Paulis to Paulis. So we can compute how each error propagates through the subsequent gates.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s denote the gates:
U_1 = CNOT_{12}
U_2 = CNOT_{10}
U_3 = CNOT_{23}
U_4 = CNOT_{34}
U_5 = CNOT_{04}</p>
<p>We want to compute the effect of propagating an error that occurs after a given gate through the remaining gates. It might be easier to compute the propagation of Pauli operators through the circuit in reverse order. Alternatively, we can compute the overall transformation on Pauli operators from the beginning to the end. But careful: The errors occur at different times. We want to know: If an error E occurs on qubits (i,j) after a particular gate, what is the equivalent Pauli operator at the end? That is: For an error after gate k, we want to compute: E_final = (U_{k+1} &hellip; U_5)^\dagger E (U_{k+1} &hellip; U_5). Because then the overall error becomes product of these transformed errors. But careful: The order: The overall error is: E_total = (U_5&hellip;U_{k+1}) E (U_{k+1}^\dagger&hellip;U_5^\dagger)? Actually, let&rsquo;s derive properly:</p>
<p>We have: Actual operator = U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1.
Write this as: U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1 * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger E4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger E3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger E2 U_1) * E1.
So if we define:
For error after gate 1 (E1): It is not conjugated? Actually, it is just E1. But careful: The order: The product is: (conjugation of E5 by U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (conjugation of E4 by U_3 U_2 U_1) * (conjugation of E3 by U_2 U_1) * (conjugation of E2 by U_1) * (E1). So if we want to move all errors to the end, we define:
E1_final = E1 (but then acted by? Actually, E1 is applied at the very beginning? But then it goes through all gates? Actually, careful: E1 is applied after U_1. So it will be acted on by U_2, U_3, U_4, U_5. So actually, the transformation for E1 is: E1_final = U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 E1 U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger U_5^\dagger. That is different from the above. Because above, we conjugated E2 by U_1, but then that product becomes: (U_1^\dagger E2 U_1) is actually the error from gate 2 propagated through U_1? Actually, wait: Our circuit order: 
Step: U_1, then E1, then U_2, then E2, then U_3, then E3, then U_4, then E4, then U_5, then E5.
So if I want to move all errors to the end, I would write: 
= U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1
= U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1 * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger E4 U_3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger E3 U_2 U_1) * (U_1^\dagger E2 U_1) * E1.
So indeed, E1 is not conjugated by anything? That is because E1 is applied after U_1, but then U_2, U_3, U_4, U_5 act on it. But here, we have E1 at the very end. That suggests that actually, the transformation to move errors to the end is: For an error after gate k, the transformation is: (U_1^\dagger &hellip; U_{k-1}^\dagger) E_k (U_{k-1} &hellip; U_1)? That doesn&rsquo;t look symmetric. Let&rsquo;s do it step by step:
We want to write: U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1 = U_total * F, where F is an operator that acts on the initial state? Actually, we want to see the effect on the final state. The ideal final state is U_total |initial&gt;. With errors, the state is U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1 |initial&gt;. = U_total * (U_total^\dagger U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1) |initial&gt;. So define F = U_total^\dagger U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1. Then the final state is U_total F |initial&gt;. But |initial&gt; is |0&gt;^5. And U_total |initial&gt; is the ideal state. So F is such that F|initial&gt; becomes the error state relative to the ideal state? Actually, careful: U_total is unitary. So if we define |ψ_ideal&gt; = U_total|initial&gt;, then the actual state is U_total F U_total^\dagger |ψ_ideal&gt;? Because U_total F |initial&gt; = U_total F U_total^\dagger U_total|initial&gt; = (U_total F U_total^\dagger) |ψ_ideal&gt;. So the overall error operator on the ideal final state is E_total = U_total F U_total^\dagger, where F = U_total^\dagger U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1.
Now, U_total = U_5 U_4 U_3 U_2 U_1.
So F = (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger U_5^\dagger) U_5 E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1 = U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1.
Then F = U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger E4 U_3) * (U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger E3 U_2) * (U_1^\dagger E2 U_1) * E1? But careful with order: Actually, U_1^\dagger U_2^\dagger U_3^\dagger U_4^\dagger E5 U_4 E4 U_3 E3 U_2 E2 U_1 E1. This is not simply a product of conjugated terms because the U&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t commute with the E&rsquo;s? But they are on different qubits? Actually, they act on overlapping qubits. So it&rsquo;s not simply a product of independently conjugated errors. We need to compute the propagation of each error through the subsequent gates carefully.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s easier to compute the effect of each error by tracking how it propagates through the circuit. Since the circuit is Clifford, we can compute the conjugation rules for Pauli operators through each gate. We have 5 gates. Let&rsquo;s denote the gates in order:
Gate 1: CNOT_{12} (control 1, target 2)
Gate 2: CNOT_{10} (control 1, target 0)
Gate 3: CNOT_{23} (control 2, target 3)
Gate 4: CNOT_{34} (control 3, target 4)
Gate 5: CNOT_{04} (control 0, target 4)</p>
<p>We will consider an error that occurs after a particular gate. That error is a Pauli on the two qubits that gate acts on. Then it will be acted upon by all subsequent gates. So we want to compute: For an error after gate k, what is the resulting Pauli operator at the end (on qubits 0,1,2,3,4) after applying gates k+1 through 5. Let&rsquo;s denote that as P_final(k) for an error E on the qubits of gate k.</p>
<p>We can do this gate by gate. Let&rsquo;s list the gates in order they are applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>CNOT_{12}</li>
<li>CNOT_{10}</li>
<li>CNOT_{23}</li>
<li>CNOT_{34}</li>
<li>CNOT_{04}</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if an error occurs after gate 1, it will go through gates 2,3,4,5.
If after gate 2, through gates 3,4,5.
If after gate 3, through gates 4,5.
If after gate 4, through gate 5.
If after gate 5, no subsequent gates, so it remains as is.</p>
<p>So we need to compute the conjugation rules for Pauli operators through these CNOT gates. Recall: CNOT_{control, target} conjugation:
On control and target qubits, if we have a Pauli operator P ⊗ Q, then under CNOT, it becomes:
X_c -&gt; X_c X_t
X_t -&gt; X_t
Z_c -&gt; Z_c
Z_t -&gt; Z_c Z_t
And for products, use that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s denote qubits: 0,1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>We will compute the propagation for each gate&rsquo;s error separately.</p>
<p>But careful: The errors from different gates commute? They are applied at different times, but since they are Pauli, the overall effect is the product of these propagated errors (but order matters because they might not commute? Actually, if we have two errors E and F that occur at different times, the overall operator is U_total * (U_total^\dagger E U_total) * (U_total^\dagger F U_total) but careful with order: They become products of operators that are conjugated by different parts of the circuit. Actually, because the errors are applied at different times, the overall effect is not simply the product of the individually propagated errors because the propagation of an earlier error goes through more gates than a later error. But since the gates are Clifford, the propagated errors will be Pauli operators. And Pauli operators commute up to a phase? Actually, they might not commute, but since they are applied to the state, the overall effect is the product of these Pauli operators. However, the order of multiplication is important because if two Pauli operators anticommute, then the product order matters. But note: The errors occur independently. We want to compute the probability that the overall error is a certain Pauli. That overall error is the product of the contributions from each gate error. But these contributions are not independent because they come from different gates. However, for small p, we can compute to first order in p. That is, we consider that at most one gate has an error (since probability of two errors is order p^2). So to first order in p, the fidelity will be 1 - (probability that a single error occurs that leads to a logical error that is not detected) and also maybe some errors that are detected are discarded, so they don&rsquo;t contribute to fidelity? But careful: The fidelity is conditional on post-selection. So we want: F = (Probability that no error occurs) + (Probability that an error occurs that is undetectable and is actually a stabilizer) all divided by (Probability that post-selection occurs). And to first order in p, the probability of post-selection is 1 - (probability of detectable error) because if an error occurs that is detectable, then we discard. So then F = 1 - (probability of undetectable logical error) to first order? Actually, if there is no error, fidelity=1. If there is an error that is a stabilizer, fidelity=1 as well because that acts trivially on the code space. If there is an error that is a logical operator, then fidelity=0. So to first order, the reduction in fidelity is the probability of an error that is a logical operator and that also passes the ancilla measurement condition and code condition. But wait, also the ancilla measurement condition: The error must not flip the ancilla measurement. So we need to compute for each single error (on one gate) what is the resulting Pauli on the final state. Then check: Does it commute with Z_4? (so that ancilla is still |0&gt;)
And does it commute with XXXX and ZZZZ on data? (so that it is undetectable)
And if it does, then it is either a stabilizer or a logical operator. We want those that are logical operators to reduce fidelity.
And also, if an error occurs on two gates, that is order p^2, so we ignore for first order.</p>
<p>So we will compute for each gate, for each of the 15 possible errors on that gate, what is the final Pauli operator (on qubits 0,1,2,3,4) after propagation through the subsequent gates. Then we will determine whether it satisfies:
Condition A: On qubit 4, the Pauli is either I or Z (so that measurement gives 0).
Condition B: On data qubits (0,1,2,3), the Pauli commutes with XXXX and ZZZZ. That means that the Pauli on data must be in the set of operators that are products of stabilizers and logical operators. But we need to identify which are stabilizers and which are logical. The stabilizers are S1 = XXXX, S2 = ZZZZ. The logical operators given: X_A = XIXI, X_B = XXII, Z_A = ZZII, Z_B = ZIZI. But careful: These are up to multiplication by stabilizers. So the logical group is generated by these. So we want to know if the data part is in the stabilizer group (then it&rsquo;s harmless) or if it is a logical operator (then it changes the state).</p>
<p>Also, note: The overall phase might matter? But Pauli errors are determined up to phase anyway.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this systematically.</p>
<p>We have gates:
Gate 1: CNOT_{12} (qubits 1 and 2)
Gate 2: CNOT_{10} (qubits 1 and 0)
Gate 3: CNOT_{23} (qubits 2 and 3)
Gate 4: CNOT_{34} (qubits 3 and 4)
Gate 5: CNOT_{04} (qubits 0 and 4)</p>
<p>We will compute the propagation for an error that occurs after each gate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s denote the Pauli operators as: X_i, Y_i, Z_i.</p>
<p>We need to know how each gate acts on Paulis. The gates are CNOTs. The conjugation rule for CNOT_{c,t}:
X_c -&gt; X_c X_t
X_t -&gt; X_t
Z_c -&gt; Z_c
Z_t -&gt; Z_c Z_t
And for products, it&rsquo;s multiplicative.</p>
<p>Also, note that Y = i X Z, so Y_c -&gt; i (X_c X_t)(Z_c) = i X_c Z_c X_t = Y_c X_t? Actually, careful: Y_c = i X_c Z_c. Under CNOT, X_c -&gt; X_c X_t, Z_c -&gt; Z_c, so Y_c -&gt; i (X_c X_t) Z_c = i X_c Z_c X_t = Y_c X_t. But then since X_t commutes with Y_c? Actually, careful: Y_c X_t is not necessarily a Pauli because of the i? Actually, Y_c is Pauli up to phase? Actually, Pauli matrices are Hermitian and square to I. But Y is defined as iXZ? Actually, usually Y = iXZ, but then Y^2 = -XZXZ = -? Actually, standard Pauli matrices: X, Y, Z with Y = iσ_y? Wait, careful: In quantum computing, Pauli matrices are often taken as X, Y, Z where Y = i? Actually, the Pauli matrices are usually: X = [[0,1],[1,0]], Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So indeed, Y = i X Z? Check: XZ = [[0,1],[1,0]][[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[0,-1],[1,0]]. So iXZ = [[0,-i],[i,0]] which is -Y actually. So actually, Y = -i XZ. So it&rsquo;s better to use the conjugation rules directly: 
For CNOT_{c,t}:
X_c -&gt; X_c X_t
Z_c -&gt; Z_c
X_t -&gt; X_t
Z_t -&gt; Z_c Z_t
Then what is Y_c? Y_c = i? Actually, since Y anticommutes with X and Z, we can derive: Y_c -&gt; ? Alternatively, we can compute: Y_c = i X_c Z_c? But then i X_c Z_c -&gt; i (X_c X_t) Z_c = i X_c Z_c X_t = Y_c X_t? But then that gives a product that is not a Pauli because of the phase? Actually, check with matrix: For a single qubit, Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Under CNOT, if control is |0&gt; then nothing, if control is |1&gt; then target is flipped. So consider Y_c acting on control. For a state |1&gt;|0&gt;, Y_c gives i|0&gt;|0&gt;? Actually, it&rsquo;s easier to use the fact that CNOT is Clifford and we can compute the image of each Pauli by conjugation. I&rsquo;ll compute explicitly for each Pauli on control and target:
For CNOT_{c,t}:
On control:
X_c -&gt; CNOT X_c CNOT. Test on |00&gt;: X_c|00&gt; = |10&gt;. CNOT|10&gt; = |11&gt;. CNOT^\dagger|11&gt; = ? Actually, better: The conjugation rule is known: 
X_c -&gt; X_c X_t
Z_c -&gt; Z_c
X_t -&gt; X_t
Z_t -&gt; Z_c Z_t
That is standard. So I&rsquo;ll use that. Then for Y_c, since Y_c = i X_c Z_c? But then careful with phases: Actually, the Pauli group usually includes phases ±1, ±i. So it&rsquo;s fine if we get a phase. But we want to know the final Pauli operator up to a phase? However, when we multiply errors, the phase might matter for the overall sign? But since we are interested in whether the error commutes with the stabilizers and logical operators, the phase doesn&rsquo;t matter. Also, for the ancilla condition, we care about the action on the state |0&gt; on ancilla. If the error has a phase, it&rsquo;s still an eigenvector? Actually, if the error is, say, i Z on ancilla, then acting on |0&gt; gives i|0&gt;, so that&rsquo;s still eigenvalue +1 for Z? Because Z|0&gt;=|0&gt;. So the condition for ancilla is that the Pauli on qubit 4 should not contain X or Y. Because X|0&gt;=|1&gt;, Y|0&gt;= i|1&gt;? Actually, careful: Y|0&gt; = i|1&gt;? Because Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], so Y|0&gt; = i|1&gt;. So that gives |1&gt; up to a phase. So indeed, we want the Pauli on qubit 4 to be either I or Z (up to a phase). So condition: The Pauli on qubit 4 should be proportional to I or Z. So we only care about the Pauli type (whether it is X or Y or Z or I). So we can ignore phases.</p>
<p>So I will compute the propagation for each error type on each gate. I&rsquo;ll create tables.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s denote the gates in order: 
Gates: 
G1: CNOT_{12}
G2: CNOT_{10}
G3: CNOT_{23}
G4: CNOT_{34}
G5: CNOT_{04}</p>
<p>We want to know: If an error E occurs after gate k, what is its effect after propagating through gates k+1,&hellip;,5. That is: P_final = (U_{k+1} &hellip; U_5)^\dagger E (U_{k+1} &hellip; U_5). But careful: The order of gates: After gate k, the subsequent gates are: for k=1: gates 2,3,4,5. For k=2: gates 3,4,5. For k=3: gates 4,5. For k=4: gate 5. For k=5: no gates.</p>
<p>So I will compute these propagations step by step.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with gate 5 errors because they are simplest.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Error occurs after gate 5. So no subsequent gates. So if an error occurs on gate 5, the final Pauli is just that error on qubits 0 and 4.
So for gate 5, errors are on qubits (0,4). They are: 
E5: possible Paulis: 
I0 I4 -&gt; I (trivial)
X0 I4 -&gt; becomes X on qubit 0, I on 4.
Y0 I4 -&gt; Y on 0, I on 4.
Z0 I4 -&gt; Z on 0, I on 4.
I0 X4 -&gt; I on 0, X on 4.
I0 Y4 -&gt; I on 0, Y on 4.
I0 Z4 -&gt; I on 0, Z on 4.
X0 X4 -&gt; X0 X4
X0 Y4 -&gt; X0 Y4
X0 Z4 -&gt; X0 Z4
Y0 X4 -&gt; Y0 X4
Y0 Y4 -&gt; Y0 Y4
Y0 Z4 -&gt; Y0 Z4
Z0 X4 -&gt; Z0 X4
Z0 Y4 -&gt; Z0 Y4
Z0 Z4 -&gt; Z0 Z4</p>
<p>But careful: The error is applied after gate 5. But gate 5 is CNOT_{04}. So the error acts on qubits 0 and 4. So these are the final operators. So we can list them and then check conditions:
Condition A: On qubit 4, the Pauli should be I or Z (so that measurement gives 0). So we require that the Pauli on qubit 4 is not X or Y.
Condition B: On data qubits (0,1,2,3), the error must commute with XXXX and ZZZZ. But note: These errors only act on qubit 0 and 4. So on data, they act only on qubit 0. So we need to check: For an operator on qubit 0, when does it commute with XXXX? XXXX acts on all data qubits. An operator on qubit 0 will commute with XXXX if it is either I or X? Actually, XXXX commutes with X on qubit 0? Check: X on qubit 0 and XXXX: They commute because X on qubit 0 commutes with X on qubit 0, and with others it&rsquo;s identity so commutes. But wait, what about Z on qubit 0? Z on qubit 0 anticommutes with X on qubit 0, but then there are X on qubits 1,2,3 which commute with Z? Actually, careful: The operator on qubit 0 is, say, Z_0. Then XXXX = X_0 X_1 X_2 X_3. Z_0 anticommutes with X_0, but X_1, X_2, X_3 commute with Z_0. So overall, Z_0 and XXXX anticommute. So condition: For an operator on qubit 0 to commute with XXXX, it must be either I or X (because X commutes with X, and Y? Y anticommutes with X? Actually, Y anticommutes with X as well because Y = iXZ, so Y X = -X Y? So Y anticommutes with X. So indeed, on a single qubit, the Pauli that commutes with X is only I and X. But wait, we also need to commute with ZZZZ. ZZZZ commutes with Z on qubit 0? Check: Z_0 and ZZZZ: Z_0 commutes with Z_0, and with others it&rsquo;s identity, so commutes. But X on qubit 0 anticommutes with Z on qubit 0? So for ZZZZ, the operator on qubit 0 must be either I or Z. So combining: For an operator on qubit 0 to commute with both XXXX and ZZZZ, it must be I (because X commutes with XXXX but not with ZZZZ, and Z commutes with ZZZZ but not with XXXX). So indeed, if an error on gate 5 acts only on qubit 0 (and not on qubit 4 in a way that affects data? Actually, wait: The condition is on the data part only. The error on gate 5 is on qubits 0 and 4. But the data part is only qubit 0. So for the data part to be undetectable, the operator on qubit 0 must commute with both stabilizers. That forces it to be identity on qubit 0. So from gate 5, if the error has any non-identity on qubit 0, then it will be detectable? But wait, could it be that the error on qubit 0 is something like X? That would anticommute with ZZZZ. So it would be detected. So indeed, for an error from gate 5 to be undetectable on the code, we need that the part on qubit 0 is I. But also, condition A requires that on qubit 4, the Pauli is I or Z. So from gate 5, the only errors that pass both conditions are those that are: I on qubit 0 and either I or Z on qubit 4. But wait: What about errors that are, say, X0 X4? That gives X on qubit 0 (detectable) and X on qubit 4 (fails ancilla condition). So indeed, from gate 5, the only errors that are accepted are: 
- No error: probability (1-p) but that&rsquo;s not an error, so that&rsquo;s good.
- Errors that are: I0 Z4? But that is: I0 Z4: That means error: on qubit 4, Z. That is allowed because ancilla condition: Z on qubit 4 is okay. And on qubit 0, identity. So that error is actually a stabilizer? But wait, does Z4 affect the data? No, because data is only qubits 0,1,2,3. So Z4 is not on data. So such an error is actually not an error on the data at all. But careful: The ancilla is measured. But if there is a Z error on the ancilla after gate 5, then the state of the ancilla is still |0&gt; because Z|0&gt;=|0&gt;. So that error is harmless. So from gate 5, the errors that are accepted are: 
E5 = I0 I4 (no error) and E5 = I0 Z4. 
But wait: Are there any others? What about errors that are, say, Z0 Z4? That gives Z on qubit 0, which is detectable because Z0 anticommutes with XXXX? Check: Z0 and XXXX: Z0 anticommutes with X0, so overall anticommute. So detectable. So yes.
So from gate 5, the only non-identity errors that are accepted are those that are exactly I on qubit 0 and Z on qubit 4. But wait: What about errors that are, say, something like? Actually, also could be: What if the error is on qubit 4 only? That is I0 X4, I0 Y4 are not allowed because they flip ancilla. I0 Z4 is allowed. So indeed, from gate 5, the accepted errors are: 
E5 = I0 I4 (no error) and E5 = I0 Z4.
But wait: Could there be an error that is, say, X0 X4? That would be detectable on data and also flip ancilla, so no.
So for gate 5, the probability of an error that passes post-selection is: 
- No error: probability (1-p)
- Error I0 Z4: probability p/15 (since there is exactly one Pauli that is I0 Z4? But careful: The Paulis are on two qubits. The Pauli I0 Z4 is one of the 15? Yes, it is I ⊗ Z. So its probability is p/15.
So from gate 5, the total probability of passing is (1-p) + p/15 = 1 - (14/15)p.
And among these, the ones that are actually no error on the data? Actually, I0 Z4 does not affect data because it&rsquo;s on ancilla only. So that is good. So from gate 5, no logical error occurs. So gate 5 contributes 0 to logical error rate to first order.</p>
<p>But wait, we are interested in fidelity. Fidelity is the probability that the state is correct given post-selection. So from gate 5 alone, if an error occurs that is I0 Z4, that is still correct state. So fidelity contribution from gate 5 errors is 1. So gate 5 does not reduce fidelity at first order.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s do gate 4 errors.
Gate 4: CNOT_{34} (qubits 3 and 4). Error occurs after gate 4. Then it goes through gate 5: CNOT_{04}.
So we need to take an error E on qubits 3 and 4 from gate 4, and then propagate it through gate 5.
Let&rsquo;s denote the error on gate 4 as: E4 = P_3 Q_4, where P,Q ∈ {I,X,Y,Z} but not both I.
We want to compute: E4_final = U_5^\dagger E4 U_5, where U_5 = CNOT_{04}.
CNOT_{04} acts on qubits 0 and 4. So it will affect the part on qubit 4 potentially, and也可能 affect qubit 0? But our error E4 is on qubits 3 and 4. So it commutes with operations on qubit 0? Actually, careful: U_5 = CNOT_{04} acts on qubits 0 and 4. So it will conjugate an operator on qubit 4. But it does not affect qubit 3 because qubit 3 is not involved. So we only need to see how the part on qubit 4 transforms under CNOT_{04}. But careful: The conjugation by CNOT_{04} on an operator that acts on qubit 4: The rule for CNOT_{04} is: 
On control (qubit 0): X_0 -&gt; X_0 X_4, Z_0 -&gt; Z_0.
On target (qubit 4): X_4 -&gt; X_4, Z_4 -&gt; Z_0 Z_4.
But our operator E4 acts on qubit 4 and qubit 3. Since qubit 3 is not involved, it remains as is. So we only need to transform the Pauli on qubit 4 according to the rule for the target of CNOT_{04}? But careful: The rule for the target: 
X_4 -&gt; X_4 (unchanged)
Z_4 -&gt; Z_0 Z_4.
But wait, that rule is when the operator is solely on qubit 4. But if the operator is on qubit 4 and also on qubit 0? But here, our operator E4 does not act on qubit 0 initially. So it&rsquo;s fine.
So, under CNOT_{04}, the transformation on an operator that acts on qubit 4 is:
I_4 -&gt; I_4
X_4 -&gt; X_4
Y_4 -&gt; ? Let&rsquo;s derive Y_4: Y_4 = i? Actually, careful: Y_4 is not simply given by that rule because Y_4 anticommutes with Z_4. But we can use: Y_4 = i X_4 Z_4? But then under CNOT, X_4 -&gt; X_4, Z_4 -&gt; Z_0 Z_4, so Y_4 -&gt; i X_4 (Z_0 Z_4) = i Z_0 X_4 Z_4 = Z_0 (i X_4 Z_4) but careful: Z_0 commutes with X_4 and Z_4? Actually, Z_0 acts on a different qubit, so it&rsquo;s separate. So Y_4 -&gt; Z_0 Y_4. But wait, check with phase: Actually, let&rsquo;s do it systematically: For CNOT_{04}, the action on Pauli on qubit 4 alone: 
We know: CNOT_{04} X_4 CNOT_{04} = X_4 (since target X is unchanged)
CNOT_{04} Z_4 CNOT_{04} = Z_0 Z_4.
So then for Y_4, since Y_4 = i X_4 Z_4? But then CNOT Y_4 CNOT = i (CNOT X_4 CNOT)(CNOT Z_4 CNOT) = i (X_4)(Z_0 Z_4) = i Z_0 X_4 Z_4. But note that Z_0 and X_4 commute because they act on different qubits, so this is Z_0 (i X_4 Z_4) = Z_0 Y_4. But wait, is that correct? Check: Y_4 = [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Under CNOT, if control is |0&gt;, then target is unchanged, so Y_4 remains Y_4. If control is |1&gt;, then target is flipped, so Y_4 becomes? Actually, careful: CNOT_{04} applied to a state where qubit 0 is |1&gt; and qubit 4 is something: CNOT|1&gt;|ψ&gt; = |1&gt; X|ψ&gt;. So then if we have an operator Y_4 acting on qubit 4, then CNOT Y_4 CNOT will act as: on states with control=0, it acts as Y_4; on states with control=1, it acts as X Y_4 X = ? X Y X = -Y? Actually, X Y X = -Y because X and Y anticommute. So indeed, if control is 1, then Y_4 becomes -Y_4. So overall, CNOT Y_4 CNOT = Z_0 ⊗ Y_4? Because Z_0 gives +1 for |0&gt; and -1 for |1&gt;. So that matches: Z_0 Y_4. So yes, Y_4 -&gt; Z_0 Y_4.
So summary for gate 4 error propagation through gate 5:
We have E4 = (on qubit 3: P) and (on qubit 4: Q). Under CNOT_{04}, the part on qubit 3 remains unchanged. The part on qubit 4 transforms as:
If Q = I, then remains I.
If Q = X, then remains X.
If Q = Y, then becomes: Y -&gt; Z_0 Y? Actually, careful: It becomes: on qubit 4, still Y, but multiplied by Z_0 on qubit 0. So that means the error becomes: (on qubit 0: Z) and (on qubit 4: Y) but wait, originally there was no operator on qubit 0. So then the final error will act on qubit 0 as well.
If Q = Z, then Z -&gt; Z_0 Z, so becomes: (on qubit 0: Z) and (on qubit 4: Z).</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s list all 15 possibilities for E4 and then compute E4_final after gate 5:</p>
<p>E4 is on qubits (3,4). Write it as: (P3, Q4) where P,Q ∈ {I,X,Y,Z} and not both I.
After gate 5 (CNOT_{04}), the resulting operator will be on qubits: It will involve qubit 3 as before, and qubit 4 as before? But careful: The transformation on qubit 4: 
- If Q = I: then remains I.
- If Q = X: then remains X.
- If Q = Y: then becomes: Z_0 * Y_4? Actually, as derived: CNOT_{04} Y_4 CNOT_{04} = Z_0 Y_4. So that means the operator becomes: on qubit 0: Z, and on qubit 4: Y.
- If Q = Z: then becomes: Z_0 Z_4, so on qubit 0: Z, and on qubit 4: Z.</p>
<p>But wait: What if P is not I? That doesn&rsquo;t interact because qubit 3 is not involved.
So then E4_final will be: 
For each E4 = (P3, Q4):
Case Q = I: Final = (P3, I4)   (no change on qubit 0)
Case Q = X: Final = (P3, X4)   (no change on qubit 0)
Case Q = Y: Final = (Z0, P3, Y4)   because we get an extra Z on qubit 0.
Case Q = Z: Final = (Z0, P3, Z4)</p>
<p>But careful: There is also the possibility that P itself might be something that acts on qubit 0? But no, P is on qubit 3 only.
So we list:</p>
<p>E4 possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>(I3, I4) -&gt; (I3, I4) -&gt; trivial.</li>
<li>(X3, I4) -&gt; (X3, I4)</li>
<li>(Y3, I4) -&gt; (Y3, I4)</li>
<li>(Z3, I4) -&gt; (Z3, I4)</li>
<li>(I3, X4) -&gt; (I3, X4)</li>
<li>(X3, X4) -&gt; (X3, X4)</li>
<li>(Y3, X4) -&gt; (Y3, X4)</li>
<li>(Z3, X4) -&gt; (Z3, X4)</li>
<li>(I3, Y4) -&gt; becomes: (Z0, I3, Y4) so that is: Z0 on qubit 0, I on qubit 3? Actually, careful: (I3, Y4) -&gt; (Z0, I3, Y4) but wait, originally there is no operator on qubit 3? Actually, it is I3, so it remains I3. So final: Z0, Y4.</li>
<li>(X3, Y4) -&gt; (Z0, X3, Y4)</li>
<li>(Y3, Y4) -&gt; (Z0, Y3, Y4)</li>
<li>(Z3, Y4) -&gt; (Z0, Z3, Y4)</li>
<li>(I3, Z4) -&gt; (Z0, I3, Z4) -&gt; so: Z0, Z4.</li>
<li>(X3, Z4) -&gt; (Z0, X3, Z4)</li>
<li>(Y3, Z4) -&gt; (Z0, Y3, Z4)</li>
<li>(Z3, Z4) -&gt; (Z0, Z3, Z4)</li>
</ol>
<p>But wait, there are 15, and I listed 16? Actually, (I3,I4) is not an error because that&rsquo;s identity. So the errors are from 2 to 16? Actually, there are 15 non-identity Paulis. So the list should be: 
(1) X3 I4
(2) Y3 I4
(3) Z3 I4
(4) I3 X4
(5) X3 X4
(6) Y3 X4
(7) Z3 X4
(8) I3 Y4
(9) X3 Y4
(10) Y3 Y4
(11) Z3 Y4
(12) I3 Z4
(13) X3 Z4
(14) Y3 Z4
(15) Z3 Z4</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll renumber them as:
1: X3 I4 -&gt; final: X3 I4
2: Y3 I4 -&gt; final: Y3 I4
3: Z3 I4 -&gt; final: Z3 I4
4: I3 X4 -&gt; final: I3 X4
5: X3 X4 -&gt; final: X3 X4
6: Y3 X4 -&gt; final: Y3 X4
7: Z3 X4 -&gt; final: Z3 X4
8: I3 Y4 -&gt; final: Z0, Y4   (so on qubits: 0: Z, 3: I, 4: Y)
9: X3 Y4 -&gt; final: Z0, X3, Y4
10: Y3 Y4 -&gt; final: Z0, Y3, Y4
11: Z3 Y4 -&gt; final: Z0, Z3, Y4
12: I3 Z4 -&gt; final: Z0, Z4   (so: qubit 0: Z, qubit 4: Z)
13: X3 Z4 -&gt; final: Z0, X3, Z4
14: Y3 Z4 -&gt; final: Z0, Y3, Z4
15: Z3 Z4 -&gt; final: Z0, Z3, Z4</p>
<p>Now, we need to check conditions for these errors (from gate 4) to be accepted.
Condition A: On qubit 4, the Pauli must be I or Z. So we require that the Pauli on qubit 4 is not X or Y.
Condition B: On data qubits (0,1,2,3), the error must commute with XXXX and ZZZZ.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through each:</p>
<p>1: X3 I4 -&gt; data: only X on qubit 3. Check: X3 commutes with XXXX? XXXX involves X on all qubits. X3 commutes with X on qubit 3, but what about with others? Actually, X3 acts only on qubit 3. For it to commute with XXXX, we need that the operator on qubit 3 is either I or X? Actually, as argued before, for a single qubit operator to commute with XXXX, it must be I or X? But wait, check: X3 and XXXX: X3 commutes with X0, X1, X2, X3? Actually, X3 commutes with X3, so that&rsquo;s fine. But also it must commute with ZZZZ. ZZZZ: Z on qubits 0,1,2,3. X3 anticommutes with Z3. So X3 does not commute with ZZZZ. So detectable. So 1 is detectable -&gt; discard.
2: Y3 I4 -&gt; data: Y on qubit 3. Y anticommutes with X? Actually, Y anticommutes with X and Z. So it will anticommute with both stabilizers? Check: Y3 and XXXX: Y3 anticommutes with X3, so overall anticommute. So detectable. Discard.
3: Z3 I4 -&gt; data: Z on qubit 3. Z3 commutes with ZZZZ? Yes, because Z3 commutes with Z3. But with XXXX: XXXX has X on qubit 3, so Z3 anticommutes with that. So detectable. Discard.
4: I3 X4 -&gt; data: I on data? Actually, careful: This error is on qubit 4 only: X4. But condition A: On qubit 4, we require I or Z. X4 is not allowed because it flips ancilla. So discard.
5: X3 X4 -&gt; data: X3, and ancilla: X4 -&gt; fails condition A because ancilla has X. Discard.
6: Y3 X4 -&gt; data: Y3, ancilla: X4 -&gt; fails condition A.
7: Z3 X4 -&gt; data: Z3, ancilla: X4 -&gt; fails condition A.
8: I3 Y4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, Y4. So data: Z on qubit 0. Ancilla: Y on qubit 4 -&gt; fails condition A because Y4 is not I or Z? Actually, condition A: On qubit 4, must be I or Z. Y is not allowed. So discard.
9: X3 Y4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, X3, Y4. Data: Z on qubit 0 and X on qubit 3. Ancilla: Y4 -&gt; fails condition A.
10: Y3 Y4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, Y3, Y4. Data: Z0 and Y3. Ancilla: Y4 -&gt; fails.
11: Z3 Y4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, Z3, Y4. Data: Z0 and Z3. Ancilla: Y4 -&gt; fails.
12: I3 Z4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, Z4. Data: Z on qubit 0. Ancilla: Z4 -&gt; condition A: ancilla is Z, so okay. Condition B: Data: Z0. As discussed, Z0 alone: Does it commute with XXXX? Z0 anticommutes with X0, so it anticommutes with XXXX. So detectable. So discard.
13: X3 Z4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, X3, Z4. Data: Z0 and X3. Ancilla: Z4 -&gt; condition A okay. Condition B: Check data: Operator = Z0 X3. Does this commute with XXXX? XXXX = X0 X1 X2 X3. Z0 anticommutes with X0, so that gives a sign. X3 commutes with X3? Actually, careful: The operator is on qubits 0 and 3. For it to commute with XXXX, we need that the number of qubits where the operator is X or Y? Actually, better: An operator will commute with XXXX if it has an even number of Paulis that anticommute with X? Actually, since XXXX is a product of X&rsquo;s on all qubits, an operator that is a product of Paulis on some qubits will commute with XXXX if and only if it has an even number of qubits where the Pauli is either Z or Y (because Z and Y anticommute with X) and an even number where it is X? Actually, wait: X commutes with X, so that&rsquo;s fine. So the condition is: The operator should have an even number of qubits on which it is either Z or Y. Here, on qubit 0, we have Z (anticommutes with X), on qubit 3, we have X (commutes with X). So that&rsquo;s 1 anticommuting, so overall anticommutes with XXXX. So detectable. Discard.
14: Y3 Z4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, Y3, Z4. Data: Z0 and Y3. Both Z0 and Y3 anticommute with X? Actually, Z0 anticommutes with X0, Y3 anticommutes with X3. So that gives 2 anticommuting, so even -&gt; might commute? Check: XXXX * (Z0 Y3) = ( anticommute: X0 and Z0 give -1, X3 and Y3 give -1, so product (-1)<em>(-1)=1) so it commutes with XXXX. Now check with ZZZZ: ZZZZ = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3. Z0 commutes with Z0, Y3: Y3 anticommutes with Z3 because Y anticommutes with Z. So that gives one anticommutation, so overall anticommutes with ZZZZ. So detectable. Discard.
15: Z3 Z4 -&gt; becomes: Z0, Z3, Z4. Data: Z0 and Z3. Check with XXXX: Z0 anticommutes with X0, Z3 anticommutes with X3, so that&rsquo;s 2 anticommutations -&gt; commutes with XXXX. With ZZZZ: Z0 commutes, Z3 commutes, so commutes with ZZZZ. So this error is undetectable. So from gate 4, error number 15: Z3 Z4 becomes after propagation: Z0 Z3 Z4? Actually, careful: It becomes: from (Z3, Z4) -&gt; becomes: (Z0, Z3, Z4) so the data part is Z0 Z3. Is that a logical error or a stabilizer? The stabilizers are XXXX and ZZZZ. Z0 Z3 is not obviously a stabilizer. Could it be a logical operator? The logical operators: Z_A = ZZII, Z_B = ZIZI. Z0 Z3: That is on qubits 0 and 3. That is not one of these directly. But it could be equivalent to a logical operator up to stabilizers? For example, Z0 Z3. Compare with Z_A = Z0 Z1? Actually, Z_A = ZZII means on qubits 0 and 1: Z0 Z1. Z0 Z3 is not that. Z_B = ZIZI means on qubits 0 and 2: Z0 Z2? Actually, careful: Z_B = ZIZI: that means qubit 0: Z, qubit 1: I, qubit 2: Z, qubit 3: I. So Z0 Z3 is not that either. But maybe Z0 Z3 can be written as (Z0 Z3) = (Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3) * (Z1 Z2)? And Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 is the stabilizer S2? Actually, S2 = ZZZZ. So Z0 Z3 = (ZZZZ) * (Z1 Z2)? That would be Z1 Z2? But Z1 Z2 is not a stabilizer because stabilizers are only ZZZZ and XXXX. So Z1 Z2 is not a stabilizer. Alternatively, maybe it is a logical operator? The logical operators are 4-dimensional. The group of undetectable errors on data is generated by stabilizers and logical operators. The stabilizer group is {I, XXXX, ZZZZ, XXXX ZZZZ}? Actually, careful: The stabilizers are S1 = XXXX and S2 = ZZZZ. They commute? They commute because XXXX and ZZZZ: on each qubit, X and Z anticommute, so overall sign = (-1)^4 = 1. So the stabilizer group has 4 elements: I, XXXX, ZZZZ, XXXX ZZZZ.
The logical operators: X_A = XIXI, X_B = XXII, Z_A = ZZII, Z_B = ZIZI. So what is Z0 Z3? 
We can check if Z0 Z3 commutes with all stabilizers? It does, as we checked. So it is in the normalizer. Is it in the stabilizer? That would require that Z0 Z3 is either I, XXXX, ZZZZ, or XXXX ZZZZ. Clearly not.
So it must be a logical operator. Which logical operator? It acts on qubits 0 and 3. Compare with Z_A = Z0 Z1. So if we multiply Z0 Z3 by Z_A^\dagger, we get Z0 Z3 * (Z0 Z1) = Z3 Z1? That is Z1 Z3, which is not a stabilizer generally. What about Z_B = Z0 Z2? Then Z0 Z3 * (Z0 Z2) = Z3 Z2, not stabilizer. What about product of logical operators? Possibly Z0 Z3 could be equivalent to Z_A Z_B? That would be (Z0 Z1)(Z0 Z2) = Z1 Z2, no.
Maybe it is a logical operator on its own. The logical space is 2 qubits, so there are 15 non-identity logical operators. They are products of X_A, X_B, Z_A, Z_B. So we want to see if Z0 Z3 can be written as a product of these up to a stabilizer. Let&rsquo;s try: Suppose Z0 Z3 = (stabilizer) * (Z_A^a Z_B^b). The stabilizer could be ZZZZ. ZZZZ = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3. Then ZZZZ * Z_A = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 * Z0 Z1 = Z2 Z3. That is not Z0 Z3.
Maybe ZZZZ * Z_B = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 * Z0 Z2 = Z1 Z3.
Maybe ZZZZ * Z_A Z_B = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 * Z0 Z1 Z0 Z2? Actually, careful: Z_A Z_B = (Z0 Z1)(Z0 Z2) = Z1 Z2? Because Z0^2=1. So that gives Z1 Z2, no.
What about using XXXX? XXXX is not helpful because it has X&rsquo;s.
Maybe Z0 Z3 is actually a logical operator that is not one of the given ones but is equivalent to, say, something like? The logical operators are defined up to stabilizers. The group of undetectable errors on 4 qubits is of order 4</em>4=16. The stabilizer subgroup is order 4, so the logical group is order 4. Actually, wait: The code is [[4,2,2]], so it encodes 2 logical qubits. The logical Pauli group for 2 qubits has 16 elements (including phases). So the set of logical operators (non-identity) is 15. They are all products of the generators. So Z0 Z3 must be one of them. Let&rsquo;s determine it by its action on the logical basis. The logical |00&gt; is (|0000&gt;+|1111&gt;)/√2. What does Z0 Z3 do to that? Z0 Z3|0000&gt; = |0000&gt; (since Z|0&gt;=|0&gt;). Z0 Z3|1111&gt; = (-1)<em>(-1)|1111&gt; = |1111&gt;. So Z0 Z3 acts as identity on |00&gt;_L. On |01&gt;_L, which is (|0011&gt;+|1100&gt;)/√2, Z0 Z3|0011&gt; = (|0011&gt;) because qubit0=0, qubit3=1 gives -1? Actually, careful: Z0 Z3|0011&gt; = (Z0 on qubit0: qubit0 is 0 so factor 1) (Z3 on qubit3: qubit3 is 1 so factor -1) so overall -1. And Z0 Z3|1100&gt; = (qubit0=1 -&gt; -1, qubit3=0 -&gt; +1) so overall -1. So actually, Z0 Z3|01&gt;_L = -|01&gt;_L. So it seems Z0 Z3 acts as -I on the second logical qubit? But wait, it should be a logical operator. It acts on both logical qubits? Actually, if it acts as identity on the first logical qubit and -1 on the second, then that would be I ⊗ (-Z) maybe? But then that is a logical operator. So indeed, Z0 Z3 is a logical operator. Specifically, it seems Z0 Z3 = I ⊗ (-Z) up to maybe a phase? But then that would flip the sign of |01&gt; but not |00&gt;. So that is a logical error on qubit B. So such an error would reduce fidelity because it would change |00&gt; to something that is not |00&gt;? Actually, if the error is I ⊗ (-Z), then on |00&gt;, that gives |00&gt; because -Z on |0&gt; is -|0&gt;? Actually, careful: For a single qubit, Z|0&gt;=|0&gt;, so -Z|0&gt; = -|0&gt;. So that would actually give a phase of -1. But phases are not important for fidelity? Fidelity is the overlap squared. If the state is -|00&gt;, that is still |00&gt; up to a global phase. So wait: If an error is a Pauli that is actually a stabilizer of the logical state? But careful: The logical state |00&gt; is not necessarily an eigenstate of all logical operators. For example, Z_B on |00&gt; gives? Z_B = ZIZI. On |00&gt;_L = (|0000&gt;+|1111&gt;)/√2, Z_B|0000&gt; = |0000&gt; (since qubit0: Z|0&gt;=|0&gt;, qubit2: Z|0&gt;=|0&gt;), and Z_B|1111&gt; = (Z|1&gt; on qubit0 gives -|1&gt;, on qubit2 gives -|1&gt;) so product positive? Actually, careful: |1111&gt; means qubits: 1,1,1,1. Z_B acts on qubit0 and qubit2. So Z_B|1111&gt; = (-1)</em>(-1)|1111&gt; = |1111&gt;. So Z_B|00&gt;_L = |00&gt;_L. So Z_B is identity on |00&gt;_L. What about I ⊗ Z? That would be on the second logical qubit. But our logical operators are defined as X_A, X_B, Z_A, Z_B. We have Z_A = ZZII and Z_B = ZIZI. So what is I ⊗ Z in terms of these? That would be something like? Actually, the logical space is 2 qubits, so the logical operators are not unique. But we can determine the action of Z0 Z3 on the logical basis. The logical basis states are:
|00&gt;_L = (|0000&gt;+|1111&gt;)/√2
|01&gt;_L = (|0011&gt;+|1100&gt;)/√2
|10&gt;_L = (|0101&gt;+|1010&gt;)/√2
|11&gt;_L = (|0110&gt;+|1001&gt;)/√2? I need to be careful with the [[4,2,2]] code. Actually, the code is defined by stabilizers XXXX and ZZZZ. The logical operators given are: X_A = XIXI, X_B = XXII, Z_A = ZZII, Z_B = ZIZI. So then the logical states are:
|00&gt;_L is the simultaneous +1 eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B. 
Z_A = ZZII means on qubits 0 and 1: Z. So |00&gt;_L should have qubits 0 and 1 in the same state? Actually, Z_A|00&gt;_L = +|00&gt;_L implies that the parity of qubits 0 and 1 is even? Similarly, Z_B = ZIZI means on qubits 0 and 2: Z. So |00&gt;_L has qubits 0 and 2 same. So indeed, |00&gt;_L is spanned by |0000&gt; and |1111&gt; (and also |0011&gt;? Check: |0011&gt;: qubits 0=0,1=0 -&gt; even, so Z_A gives +1; qubits 0=0,2=0 -&gt; even, so Z_B gives +1. So actually, |0011&gt; is also a +1 eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B? But wait, then |0011&gt; and |0000&gt; are not necessarily in the same code space because they must also be +1 eigenstates of XXXX. XXXX|0011&gt; = |1100&gt; which is not proportional to |0011&gt; generally. So the code space is 4-dimensional. The conditions are: XXXX=+1 and ZZZZ=+1. So |0000&gt; has ZZZZ=+1? Actually, ZZZZ|0000&gt;=|0000&gt;, so okay. |1111&gt; works. |0011&gt;: ZZZZ|0011&gt; = (-1)<em>(-1)|0011&gt; = |0011&gt;, so that works. But XXXX|0011&gt; = |1100&gt;, so |0011&gt; is not an eigenvector of XXXX unless |0011&gt; is proportional to |1100&gt;, which it is not. So the code space is actually 2-dimensional? Wait, [[4,2,2]] means 4 physical qubits, 2 logical qubits, so code space dimension is 4. I recall that the [[4,2,2]] code is actually a product of two [[4,1,2]] codes? Actually, [[4,2,2]] means distance 2, so it can detect one error but not correct. Its stabilizers are XXXX and ZZZZ. The code space is indeed 4-dimensional because there are 4 qubits and 2 independent stabilizers, so 2^2=4. So the logical basis states are:
|00&gt;_L = (|0000&gt;+|1111&gt;)/√2
|01&gt;_L = (|0011&gt;+|1100&gt;)/√2
|10&gt;_L = (|0101&gt;+|1010&gt;)/√2
|11&gt;_L = (|0110&gt;+|1001&gt;)/√2
Check: XXXX on these: For |00&gt;_L, XXXX gives (|1111&gt;+|0000&gt;)/√2 = same, so +1. ZZZZ gives (|0000&gt;+(-1)^4|1111&gt;)/√2 = same, so +1.
For |01&gt;_L, XXXX gives (|1100&gt;+|0011&gt;)/√2 = same, so +1. ZZZZ gives: on |0011&gt;, ZZZZ gives (-1)</em>(-1)=+1, on |1100&gt;, (-1)<em>(-1)=+1, so okay.
So then what are the actions of the logical operators? 
Z_A = ZZII. On |00&gt;_L: Z_A|0000&gt;=|0000&gt;, Z_A|1111&gt;= (Z on qubit0 and1: on |11&gt;, Z gives -1 each? Actually, careful: Z_A = Z0 Z1. So on |1111&gt;, Z0 gives -1, Z1 gives -1, product = +1. So Z_A|00&gt;_L = |00&gt;_L.
On |01&gt;_L: |0011&gt;: Z0 gives +1 (0), Z1 gives +1 (0) so product=+1; |1100&gt;: Z0 gives -1, Z1 gives -1, product=+1. So Z_A|01&gt;_L = |01&gt;_L. So actually, Z_A acts as identity on both? That would mean Z_A is actually a stabilizer? But wait, Z_A is given as a logical operator. They are defined up to stabilizers. Actually, check: Z_A = ZZII. But note that ZZZZ is a stabilizer. So Z_A * (Z2 Z3) would give Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 which is ZZZZ. So Z_A is equivalent to Z2 Z3 up to a stabilizer. So the logical operators are not unique. We should use the given ones: X_A = XIXI, X_B = XXII, Z_A = ZZII, Z_B = ZIZI. Then on |00&gt;_L, 
Z_A|00&gt;_L: For |0000&gt;, Z_A gives +1; for |1111&gt;, Z_A gives (Z on qubit0: -1, on qubit1: -1) so product=+1. So Z_A acts as I on |00&gt;_L.
Z_B|00&gt;_L: For |0000&gt;, Z_B gives +1; for |1111&gt;, Z_B gives (Z on qubit0: -1, on qubit2: -1) so product=+1. So both act as I on |00&gt;_L. That makes sense because |00&gt;_L is the +1 eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B.
Now, what is Z0 Z3? 
On |00&gt;_L: Z0 Z3|0000&gt; = (+1)(+1)=+1; on |1111&gt;, Z0 gives -1, Z3 gives -1, product=+1. So Z0 Z3 acts as I on |00&gt;_L.
On |01&gt;_L: |0011&gt;: Z0 gives +1, Z3 gives -1 so factor -1; |1100&gt;: Z0 gives -1, Z3 gives +1 so factor -1; so Z0 Z3|01&gt;_L = -|01&gt;_L.
On |10&gt;_L: |0101&gt;: Z0 gives +1, Z3 gives? Actually, careful: |0101&gt;: qubits: 0=0,1=1,2=0,3=1. So Z0 gives +1, Z3 gives -1, so factor -1; |1010&gt;: qubits: 1=0,0=1,2=1,3=0 -&gt; Z0 gives -1, Z3 gives +1, so factor -1; so Z0 Z3|10&gt;_L = -|10&gt;_L.
On |11&gt;_L: |0110&gt;: qubits: 0=0,3=0 so +1; |1001&gt;: qubits: 0=1 -&gt; -1, 3=1 -&gt; -1, product=+1; so Z0 Z3|11&gt;_L = +|11&gt;_L.
So Z0 Z3 acts as: on logical basis, it gives: 
|00&gt; -&gt; +1
|01&gt; -&gt; -1
|10&gt; -&gt; -1
|11&gt; -&gt; +1
That is actually equivalent to (I ⊗ Z) times (Z ⊗ I)? Actually, that is like (Z ⊗ Z) maybe? Because Z⊗Z would give: on |00&gt;: +1, |01&gt;: -1, |10&gt;: -1, |11&gt;: +1. Yes! So Z0 Z3 acts as Z_A Z_B? Because Z_A Z_B would be (ZZII)(ZIZI) = on qubits: qubit0: Z</em>Z=I? Actually, careful: Z_A Z_B = (Z0 Z1)(Z0 Z2) = Z1 Z2? That gives on |00&gt;: +1, on |01&gt;:? Actually, wait, let&rsquo;s compute Z_A Z_B properly:
Z_A = Z0 Z1
Z_B = Z0 Z2
So Z_A Z_B = Z0 Z1 Z0 Z2 = Z1 Z2 (since Z0^2=1). So Z1 Z2 would act on |00&gt;_L: |0000&gt; gives +1; |1111&gt; gives (-1)<em>(-1)=+1; on |01&gt;_L: |0011&gt; gives (+1)</em>(-1)=-1; |1100&gt; gives (-1)<em>(+1)=-1; so indeed Z1 Z2 also acts as Z⊗Z on the logical space? But wait, then Z0 Z3 is not necessarily the same as Z1 Z2 because they could differ by a stabilizer. In fact, Z0 Z3 * (Z1 Z2) = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 = ZZZZ, which is a stabilizer. So indeed, Z0 Z3 = (ZZZZ)(Z1 Z2) but careful with signs: ZZZZ gives +1 on the code space? Actually, on the code space, ZZZZ is +1. So Z0 Z3 is equivalent to Z1 Z2 on the code space. And Z1 Z2 is Z_A Z_B? Because Z_A Z_B = Z1 Z2. So indeed, Z0 Z3 is a logical operator. Specifically, it is Z_A Z_B. So that means that if this error occurs, it will change the logical state from |00&gt; to something? Actually, since |00&gt; is an eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B with eigenvalue +1, it is also an eigenstate of Z_A Z_B with eigenvalue +1. So actually, Z0 Z3 acting on |00&gt;_L gives |00&gt;_L. Wait, check: We computed Z0 Z3|00&gt;_L = |00&gt;_L. So that error would actually leave |00&gt; invariant? But then it would be fidelity 1. But wait, is that true? |00&gt;_L is an eigenvector of Z_A Z_B with eigenvalue (+1)</em>(+1)=+1. So indeed, if the error is Z_A Z_B, then it acts as identity on |00&gt;_L. But careful: Our desired state is |00&gt;_L. So if the error is a logical operator that commutes with the state, then it might still have fidelity 1. Fidelity is the overlap with the ideal state. If the error is a Pauli that is not identity but still leaves the state unchanged (up to a phase), then the state is correct. So we need to check: For an undetectable error on the data, when does it actually change the state? The state is |00&gt;_L. The logical operators that act on |00&gt;_L: 
Z_A and Z_B both act as identity on |00&gt;_L because |00&gt; is the +1 eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B.
What about X_A? X_A would flip to |10&gt;_L, so that reduces fidelity.
X_B would flip to |01&gt;_L.
X_A X_B would flip to |11&gt;_L.
Also, products like X_A Z_B etc might also change the state? But careful: The state |00&gt;_L is not an eigenvector of X operators generally. So we need to determine for each undetectable error, whether it acts as identity on |00&gt;_L or not. Since the state is |00&gt;_L, it is the simultaneous +1 eigenvector of Z_A and Z_B. So any logical operator that commutes with both Z_A and Z_B will act as a phase on |00&gt;_L. But wait, if it commutes with Z_A and Z_B, then it must be itself a product of Z_A and Z_B and stabilizers? Actually, the logical operators that commute with Z_A and Z_B are exactly those that are in the stabilizer of the state |00&gt;_L. The state |00&gt;_L is stabilized by Z_A and Z_B. So any operator that is in the group generated by Z_A and Z_B will act as ±1 on |00&gt;_L. But are those the only ones? What about operators that anticommute with either Z_A or Z_B? Those will change the state. So for an undetectable error on data, if it is equivalent to a product of Z_A and Z_B (and stabilizers), then it will still give fidelity 1 because the state remains |00&gt;_L (up to a phase). If it is equivalent to an X-type logical operator, then fidelity becomes 0.
So we need to classify the undetectable errors from each gate into those that are &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; (act as identity on |00&gt;_L) and those that are &ldquo;logical errors&rdquo; (change the state).</p>
<p>For gate 4, we found that the only undetectable error that passes conditions is number 15: Z3 Z4 -&gt; becomes Z0 Z3 Z4. But wait, check condition A: That gives on ancilla: Z4, so okay. And on data: Z0 Z3. We determined that Z0 Z3 is equivalent to Z_A Z_B (up to stabilizer) because Z0 Z3 * (Z1 Z2) = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 = stabilizer? Actually, careful: ZZZZ is a stabilizer. So Z0 Z3 = (ZZZZ)(Z1 Z2) but wait, ZZZZ acts as +1 on the code space, so indeed Z0 Z3 acts as Z1 Z2 on the code space. And Z1 Z2 is Z_A Z_B? Because Z_A = ZZII means on qubits 0 and 1? Actually, given: Z_A = ZZII means on qubits 0 and 1? The problem statement: &ldquo;Z_A = ZZII&rdquo;. That means on qubit 0: Z, qubit 1: Z, qubits 2: I, qubit 3: I. So Z_A = Z0 Z1.
Z_B = ZIZI means on qubit 0: Z, qubit 1: I, qubit 2: Z, qubit 3: I. So Z_A Z_B = (Z0 Z1)(Z0 Z2) = Z1 Z2. So yes, Z0 Z3 is equivalent to Z_A Z_B. And since |00&gt;_L is an eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B with eigenvalue +1, it is also an eigenstate of Z_A Z_B with eigenvalue +1. So this error actually does not change the state. So gate 4 error number 15 is harmless. But wait, are there any other gate 4 errors that might be undetectable? We went through 1-14 and they either failed condition A or were detectable. So gate 4 gives no first-order logical error that reduces fidelity. So gate 4 contributes 0 to infidelity at first order.</p>
<p>Now, gate 3 errors.
Gate 3: CNOT_{23} (qubits 2 and 3). Error occurs after gate 3. Then it goes through gates 4 and 5.
So we need to propagate an error E on qubits (2,3) through gate 4 (CNOT_{34}) and then gate 5 (CNOT_{04}).
Let&rsquo;s do that step by step.
Let E3 be on qubits 2 and 3. Write it as: (P2, Q3) where P,Q ∈ {I,X,Y,Z} not both I.
First, propagate through gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. So it will affect the part on qubit 3. The rule for CNOT_{34}: 
Control is qubit 3, target is qubit 4.
So under CNOT_{34}, the transformation on an operator that acts on qubit 3 is:
X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4
Z_3 -&gt; Z_3
And on qubit 4: 
X_4 -&gt; X_4
Z_4 -&gt; Z_3 Z_4
But careful: Our error E3 acts on qubits 2 and 3. Qubit 2 is not affected by gate 4 because gate 4 acts on 3 and 4 only. So after gate 4, the error becomes: 
We take E3 and conjugate it by U_4 = CNOT_{34}. That gives: U_4^\dagger E3 U_4. This will affect the Pauli on qubit 3. Let&rsquo;s do it case by case based on Q3:
If Q3 = I: then E3 = (P2, I3). Then it remains unchanged because gate 4 doesn&rsquo;t affect qubit 2 and I3 is invariant.
If Q3 = X: then E3 = (P2, X3). Under CNOT_{34}, X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4. So becomes: (P2, X3 X4) but careful: This is on qubits 2,3,4 now. So final after gate 4: (P2, X3, X4).
If Q3 = Y: then E3 = (P2, Y3). under CNOT_{34}, what is Y_3? Y_3 -&gt; ? Using similar reasoning as before: For a CNOT with control 3, target 4, the transformation on an operator on qubit 3 alone: 
X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4
Z_3 -&gt; Z_3
So Y_3 = i X_3 Z_3? Actually, careful with phase: Y_3 is usually defined as i? But let&rsquo;s derive using the fact that CNOT is real? Actually, better: We can determine the action on Y_3 by noting that Y_3 anticommutes with Z_3. Alternatively, use: CNOT_{34} Y_3 CNOT_{34} = ? Consider its action on states. Actually, I&rsquo;ll use the following method: For any Pauli on the control qubit, the rule is: 
X_c -&gt; X_c X_t
Z_c -&gt; Z_c
So if we have an operator that is solely on the control, say A_c, then its image will be A_c times something on the target that depends on A_c&rsquo;s commutation with Z_c? Actually, there is a general rule: For CNOT_{c,t}, 
I_c -&gt; I_c
X_c -&gt; X_c X_t
Y_c -&gt; Y_c X_t? Check: For CNOT, if control is |0&gt;, then Y_c remains Y_c; if control is |1&gt;, then Y_c becomes X_t Y_c X_t = -Y_c? That would give -Y_c, not Y_c X_t. Wait, let&rsquo;s derive properly:
We want to compute U^\dagger Y_3 U where U = CNOT_{34}. Write Y_3 = i σ_y on qubit 3. The CNOT matrix is: U = |0&gt;&lt;0|⊗I + |1&gt;&lt;1|⊗X. Then U^\dagger = |0&gt;&lt;0|⊗I + |1&gt;&lt;1|⊗X because X is self-inverse. So U^\dagger Y_3 U = (|0&gt;&lt;0|⊗I) Y_3 (|0&gt;&lt;0|⊗I) + (|1&gt;&lt;1|⊗X) Y_3 (|1&gt;&lt;1|⊗X) + cross terms? Actually, careful: Y_3 acts only on qubit 3. So it commutes with the projectors on qubit 3? Actually, |0&gt;&lt;0| and |1&gt;&lt;1| commute with Y? No, they don&rsquo;t commute because Y off-diagonal. So we need to compute explicitly. Maybe it&rsquo;s easier to use the fact that the conjugation by CNOT is a Clifford operation and we can determine it by its action on the generators of the Pauli group. We know how it acts on X_3 and Z_3. And since Y_3 is proportional to X_3 Z_3 (up to a phase), we can compute that. But careful: X_3 Z_3 is not necessarily Y_3 because Y_3 is usually defined as -i X_3 Z_3? Actually, Pauli matrices: X=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\1&amp;0\end{pmatrix}, Z=\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\0&amp;-1\end{pmatrix}. Then XZ = \begin{pmatrix}0&amp;-1\1&amp;0\end{pmatrix} which is iY? Actually, iY = \begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\-1&amp;0\end{pmatrix} so indeed, XZ = -iY, so Y = i XZ. So Y_3 = i X_3 Z_3. Then under CNOT, X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4, Z_3 -&gt; Z_3. So then Y_3 -&gt; i (X_3 X_4) Z_3 = i X_3 Z_3 X_4 = Y_3 X_4? But wait, check with phase: If control is |0&gt;, then Y_3 should remain Y_3. But if we have Y_3 X_4, then when control is |0&gt;, X_4 acts as identity? Actually, careful: This conjugation is operator equality. Let&rsquo;s test on a basis state |0&gt;<em>3|0&gt;_4. Then Y_3|0&gt;|0&gt; = i|1&gt;|0&gt;. Now, first apply U^\dagger Y_3 U to |0&gt;|0&gt;. U|0&gt;|0&gt; = |0&gt;|0&gt;. So U^\dagger Y_3 U|0&gt;|0&gt; = U^\dagger Y_3|0&gt;|0&gt; = U^\dagger (i|1&gt;|0&gt;) = i U^\dagger|1&gt;|0&gt; = i |1&gt;|1&gt; because U^\dagger|1&gt;|0&gt; = |1&gt; X|0&gt; = |1&gt;|1&gt;. So the result is i|1&gt;|1&gt;. Now, if we apply Y_3 X_4 to |0&gt;|0&gt;, then Y_3 X_4|0&gt;|0&gt; = Y_3|0&gt;|1&gt; = i|1&gt;|1&gt;. So that works. Test on |1&gt;|0&gt;: U^\dagger Y_3 U|1&gt;|0&gt; = U^\dagger Y_3 (|1&gt;|1&gt;) because U|1&gt;|0&gt; = |1&gt;|1&gt; actually wait: U|1&gt;|0&gt; = |1&gt; X|0&gt; = |1&gt;|1&gt;. So then U^\dagger Y_3 U|1&gt;|0&gt; = U^\dagger Y_3|1&gt;|1&gt; = U^\dagger (Y_3|1&gt;)|1&gt; = U^\dagger (-i|0&gt;)|1&gt; = -i U^\dagger|0&gt;|1&gt; = -i |0&gt;|1&gt; because U^\dagger|0&gt;|1&gt; = |0&gt;|1&gt; since control=0 gives identity on target. Now, Y_3 X_4|1&gt;|0&gt; = Y_3 X_4|1&gt;|0&gt; = Y_3|1&gt;|1&gt; = -i|0&gt;|1&gt;. So it works. So indeed, Y_3 -&gt; Y_3 X_4 under CNOT</em>{34}. But wait, check sign: Is it Y_3 X_4 or could there be a phase? Let&rsquo;s also check using the fact that CNOT_{34} X_3 CNOT_{34} = X_3 X_4 and CNOT_{34} Z_3 CNOT_{34} = Z_3. Then Y_3 = i X_3 Z_3 -&gt; i (X_3 X_4) Z_3 = i X_3 Z_3 X_4 = Y_3 X_4. So yes.
If Q3 = Z: then E3 = (P2, Z3). Under CNOT_{34}, Z_3 -&gt; Z_3 (unchanged). So remains (P2, Z3).</p>
<p>But wait, also there is the case when Q3 is something else? That covers all.</p>
<p>So after gate 4, the error becomes:
For E3 = (P2, Q3):
If Q3 = I: -&gt; (P2, I3)   (no change on qubit 4)
If Q3 = X: -&gt; (P2, X3, X4)
If Q3 = Y: -&gt; (P2, Y3, X4)   because Y3 -&gt; Y3 X4 actually gives: careful: It becomes: (P2) and then Y3 becomes Y3 times X4? So that is (P2, Y3, X4)
If Q3 = Z: -&gt; (P2, Z3)   (no change on qubit 4)</p>
<p>Now, after gate 4, we then propagate through gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Gate 5 acts on qubits 0 and 4. So now the error will involve any Pauli on qubit 4 will be affected by gate 5. Also, note that these errors may already have operators on qubit 0? Currently, after gate 4, they do not involve qubit 0 because gate 4 only acts on 3 and 4. So initially, no qubit 0 involvement. But gate 5 will introduce qubit 0 if the Pauli on qubit 4 is Y or Z as before.
So let&rsquo;s do that propagation through gate 5 for each case.</p>
<p>We have after gate 4, the error is on some set of qubits. Let&rsquo;s denote it as E3^{(4)}. Then we want E3_final = U_5^\dagger E3^{(4)} U_5, where U_5 = CNOT_{04}. And we already know how CNOT_{04} acts on Paulis on qubit 4: 
If the Pauli on qubit 4 is I -&gt; remains I.
If it is X -&gt; remains X.
If it is Y -&gt; becomes: Z0 * Y4? Actually, as before: under CNOT_{04}, for an operator on qubit 4 alone: 
X_4 -&gt; X_4
Y_4 -&gt; Z_0 Y_4
Z_4 -&gt; Z_0 Z_4.
And it does not affect other qubits that are not 0 or 4.
So now, let&rsquo;s go case by case for E3:</p>
<p>Case 1: Q3 = I: 
E3 = (P2, I3). After gate 4, remains (P2, I3). So then after gate 5, since there is no operator on qubit 4, it remains (P2, I3). So final: (P2 on qubit 2, I on others). But wait, could there be also something on qubit? Actually, careful: This error is only on qubit 2 and 3? Actually, it is (P2, I3) means on qubit 2: P, on qubit 3: I. So final: only on qubit 2.
So for each P in {X,Y,Z}:
1a: P2=I? Actually, error means non-identity, so P is X,Y,Z.
So:
1a: (X2, I3) -&gt; final: X2 only.
1b: (Y2, I3) -&gt; final: Y2 only.
1c: (Z2, I3) -&gt; final: Z2 only.</p>
<p>Now check conditions for these:
They act only on qubit 2. 
Condition A: Ancilla: no action on qubit 4, so okay.
Condition B: On data: For (X2): X2 alone. Does it commute with XXXX? X2 commutes with X2 but anticommutes with ZZZZ because ZZZZ has Z2, so detectable. So discard.
(Y2): Y2 anticommutes with both? Actually, Y2 anticommutes with X2 and Z2, so detectable. Discard.
(Z2): Z2 anticommutes with XXXX (since X2 anticommutes with Z2) so detectable. Discard.
So case 1 gives no accepted errors.</p>
<p>Case 2: Q3 = X:
E3 = (P2, X3). After gate 4, becomes: (P2, X3, X4) because X3 -&gt; X3 X4.
So after gate 4, we have: on qubit 2: P, on qubit 3: X, on qubit 4: X.
Now propagate through gate 5. Gate 5 acts on qubits 0 and 4. The part on qubit 4 is X4. Under CNOT_{04}, X4 remains X4 (since target X is unchanged). So no change on qubit 0 appears because for X4, it stays X4. So final becomes: (P2, X3, X4) still.
So for each P in {X,Y,Z}:
2a: (X2, X3, X4) -&gt; final: X2, X3, X4.
2b: (Y2, X3, X4)
2c: (Z2, X3, X4)</p>
<p>Now conditions:
Condition A: Ancilla: qubit 4 has X4 -&gt; that is not allowed because X4 will flip the ancilla measurement. So all these fail condition A. So discard.</p>
<p>Case 3: Q3 = Y:
E3 = (P2, Y3). After gate 4, becomes: (P2, Y3, X4) because Y3 -&gt; Y3 X4.
So after gate 4: on qubit 2: P, on qubit 3: Y, on qubit 4: X.
Now propagate through gate 5. Gate 5: The part on qubit 4 is X4. As before, X4 remains X4 under CNOT_{04} because for target, X stays X. So no change. So final: (P2, Y3, X4) still.
So for each P:
3a: (X2, Y3, X4)
3b: (Y2, Y3, X4)
3c: (Z2, Y3, X4)
Condition A: Ancilla: qubit 4 has X4 -&gt; fails. So discard.</p>
<p>Case 4: Q3 = Z:
E3 = (P2, Z3). After gate 4, remains: (P2, Z3) because Z3 is unchanged.
So after gate 4: (P2, Z3) only.
Now propagate through gate 5. Gate 5 acts on qubits 0 and 4. But there is no operator on qubit 4 here initially. So it remains (P2, Z3). So final: (P2, Z3) only.
So for each P:
4a: (X2, Z3)
4b: (Y2, Z3)
4c: (Z2, Z3)</p>
<p>Now conditions:
Condition A: Ancilla: no action on qubit 4, so okay.
Condition B: On data: These act on qubits 2 and 3.
4a: (X2, Z3). Check commutation with XXXX: X2 commutes with X2? Actually, XXXX involves X on all qubits. X2 commutes with itself, but Z3 anticommutes with X3. So overall, (X2, Z3) will anticommute with XXXX because there is one anticommuting factor (Z3) and one commuting (X2) gives odd number? Actually, careful: The operator is on qubit 2 and 3 only. For it to commute with XXXX, we need an even number of qubits where the Pauli is either Z or Y. Here, on qubit 2, X is okay (commutes), on qubit 3, Z anticommutes. So that is 1 anticommuting, so overall anticommutes. So detectable. Discard.
4b: (Y2, Z3). On qubit 2, Y anticommutes with X2; on qubit 3, Z anticommutes with X3; so that&rsquo;s 2 anticommuting -&gt; commutes with XXXX? Check: XXXX * (Y2 Z3) = ( anticommute: X2 and Y2 give -1, X3 and Z3 give -1) product = +1, so commutes with XXXX. Now check with ZZZZ: ZZZZ involves Z on all qubits. Y2 anticommutes with Z2? Actually, Y2 anticommutes with Z2 because Y and Z anticommute. Z3 commutes with Z3. So that gives one anticommutation -&gt; anticommutes with ZZZZ. So detectable. Discard.
4c: (Z2, Z3). On qubit 2, Z anticommutes with X2; on qubit 3, Z anticommutes with X3; so that&rsquo;s 2 anticommuting -&gt; commutes with XXXX. With ZZZZ: Z2 commutes, Z3 commutes, so commutes with ZZZZ. So this is undetectable. So from gate 3, error number 4c: (Z2, Z3) becomes final: (Z2, Z3) only.
So that error is on data: Z2 Z3. Is that harmless or logical? Z2 Z3. What is that logically? Compare with logical operators: Z_A = ZZII means on qubits 0 and 1. Z2 Z3 is not that. Z_B = ZIZI means on qubits 0 and 2. Z2 Z3 times Z_B would give? Z2 Z3 * (Z0 Z2) = Z0 Z3, which we already saw is Z_A Z_B. So Z2 Z3 is not obviously a stabilizer. Let&rsquo;s determine its action on |00&gt;_L. 
Z2 Z3|00&gt;_L: On |0000&gt;, Z2 and Z3 give +1; on |1111&gt;, Z2 gives -1, Z3 gives -1, product=+1. So it acts as identity on |00&gt;_L. So actually, Z2 Z3 is harmless as well? But wait, check on |01&gt;_L: |0011&gt;: Z2 gives +1? Actually, |0011&gt;: qubit2=0 so +1, qubit3=1 so -1, so factor -1; |1100&gt;: qubit2=1 -&gt; -1, qubit3=0 -&gt; +1, so factor -1; so Z2 Z3|01&gt;_L = -|01&gt;_L. So it acts as -I on the second logical qubit? That would be like I ⊗ (-Z) which actually leaves |0&gt; unchanged because -Z|0&gt; = -|0&gt;. So careful: If the state is |00&gt;_L, then it is an eigenvector of Z2 Z3. We need to check the eigenvalue for |00&gt;_L. For |0000&gt;, eigenvalue +1; for |1111&gt;, eigenvalue (-1)*(-1)=+1. So indeed, Z2 Z3|00&gt;_L = |00&gt;_L. So it is harmless. So gate 3 also gives no logical error that reduces fidelity at first order.</p>
<p>Now, gate 2 errors.
Gate 2: CNOT_{10} (qubits 1 and 0). Error occurs after gate 2. Then it goes through gates 3,4,5.
So we need to propagate an error E2 on qubits (1,0) through gate 3 (CNOT_{23}), gate 4 (CNOT_{34}), and gate 5 (CNOT_{04}).
Let&rsquo;s do that step by step.
E2 is on qubits 1 and 0. Write it as: (P1, Q0) where P,Q ∈ {I,X,Y,Z} not both I.
First, propagate through gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Gate 3 acts on qubits 2 and 3. So initially, E2 acts on qubits 1 and 0. Gate 3 does not act on qubits 1 and 0? Actually, careful: Gate 3 is CNOT_{23}, so it acts on qubits 2 and 3. So if E2 has no operators on qubits 2 or 3, then it commutes with gate 3. So initially, E2 is on qubits 1 and 0 only. So after gate 3, it remains the same: (P1, Q0). 
Next, propagate through gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. Again, E2 is on qubits 1 and 0 only, so it commutes with gate 4? Actually, careful: Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. There is no overlap with qubits 1 and 0. So it remains (P1, Q0).
Next, propagate through gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Gate 5 acts on qubits 0 and 4. Now, E2 involves qubit 0. So we need to see how an operator on qubit 0 transforms under CNOT_{04}. But careful: E2 is on qubits (1,0). Under CNOT_{04}, the part on qubit 0 will change if it is X or Y or Z? Actually, CNOT_{04} has control qubit 0 and target qubit 4. The rules for operators on the control qubit are:
X_0 -&gt; X_0 X_4
Z_0 -&gt; Z_0
And for operators on the target qubit are as before but that doesn&rsquo;t apply here because our operator is on qubit 0 primarily. But wait, careful: E2 is a product of Paulis on qubit 1 and qubit 0. Under CNOT_{04}, since qubit 1 is not involved, it remains unchanged. So we only need to worry about the Pauli on qubit 0. So if the Pauli on qubit 0 is:
I -&gt; remains I.
X_0 -&gt; becomes X_0 X_4.
Y_0 -&gt; becomes? For a Pauli on the control, we can derive: Y_0 = i X_0 Z_0. Under CNOT, X_0 -&gt; X_0 X_4, Z_0 -&gt; Z_0, so Y_0 -&gt; i (X_0 X_4) Z_0 = i X_0 Z_0 X_4 = Y_0 X_4. But careful with phase? Check: Actually, as before, for a CNOT, the control&rsquo;s Y becomes Y_0 X_4. 
Z_0 -&gt; remains Z_0.
So then after gate 5, the error becomes:
E2_final = (on qubit 1: P1) and (on qubit 0: depending on Q0):
If Q0 = I: then remains (P1, I0) -&gt; so final: only on qubit 1.
If Q0 = X: then becomes (P1, X0 X4) -&gt; so final: on qubit 0: X, on qubit 4: X.
If Q0 = Y: then becomes (P1, Y0 X4) -&gt; so final: on qubit 0: Y, on qubit 4: X.
If Q0 = Z: then becomes (P1, Z0) -&gt; remains only on qubit 0 and 1? Actually, careful: If Q0=Z, then it stays Z_0 because control Z is invariant. So final: (P1, Z0).</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s list all possibilities for E2. They are on qubits (1,0). So the errors are:
E2: (P1, Q0) with P,Q ∈ {X,Y,Z} actually wait, they can also be where one is I and the other is non-I? But careful: The error is on two qubits. So the possibilities are: 
P1 can be I and Q0 non-I, and vice versa, and both non-I.
So we should list systematically: 
For E2, the Pauli on qubits 1 and 0. Let&rsquo;s denote them as: </p>
<ol>
<li>(I1, X0)</li>
<li>(I1, Y0)</li>
<li>(I1, Z0)</li>
<li>(X1, I0)</li>
<li>(Y1, I0)</li>
<li>(Z1, I0)</li>
<li>(X1, X0)</li>
<li>(X1, Y0)</li>
<li>(X1, Z0)</li>
<li>(Y1, X0)</li>
<li>(Y1, Y0)</li>
<li>(Y1, Z0)</li>
<li>(Z1, X0)</li>
<li>(Z1, Y0)</li>
<li>(Z1, Z0)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, after propagation through gates 3,4,5, we get:
For each, based on the rule from gate 5 (since gates 3 and 4 do nothing because they act on different qubits):
- If the Pauli on qubit 0 is I, then it remains as is.
- If the Pauli on qubit 0 is X, then it becomes: that Pauli becomes X0 X4.
- If the Pauli on qubit 0 is Y, then becomes: Y0 X4.
- If the Pauli on qubit 0 is Z, then remains Z0 (since Z on control is invariant).</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go through each:</p>
<ol>
<li>(I1, X0) -&gt; becomes: (I1, X0 X4) so final: on qubit 0: X, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(I1, Y0) -&gt; becomes: (I1, Y0 X4) so final: on qubit 0: Y, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(I1, Z0) -&gt; becomes: (I1, Z0) so final: on qubit 0: Z only.</li>
<li>(X1, I0) -&gt; remains: (X1, I0) so final: on qubit 1: X only.</li>
<li>(Y1, I0) -&gt; remains: (Y1, I0) so final: on qubit 1: Y only.</li>
<li>(Z1, I0) -&gt; remains: (Z1, I0) so final: on qubit 1: Z only.</li>
<li>(X1, X0) -&gt; becomes: (X1, X0 X4) so final: on qubit 1: X, on qubit 0: X, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(X1, Y0) -&gt; becomes: (X1, Y0 X4) so final: on qubit 1: X, on qubit 0: Y, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(X1, Z0) -&gt; becomes: (X1, Z0) so final: on qubit 1: X, on qubit 0: Z.</li>
<li>(Y1, X0) -&gt; becomes: (Y1, X0 X4) so final: on qubit 1: Y, on qubit 0: X, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(Y1, Y0) -&gt; becomes: (Y1, Y0 X4) so final: on qubit 1: Y, on qubit 0: Y, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(Y1, Z0) -&gt; becomes: (Y1, Z0) so final: on qubit 1: Y, on qubit 0: Z.</li>
<li>(Z1, X0) -&gt; becomes: (Z1, X0 X4) so final: on qubit 1: Z, on qubit 0: X, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(Z1, Y0) -&gt; becomes: (Z1, Y0 X4) so final: on qubit 1: Z, on qubit 0: Y, on qubit 4: X.</li>
<li>(Z1, Z0) -&gt; becomes: (Z1, Z0) so final: on qubit 1: Z, on qubit 0: Z.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we need to check conditions for these errors to be accepted.
Condition A: On qubit 4, the Pauli must be I or Z. So look at the presence of X4 or Y4. In these, whenever there is an X4, that comes from cases where the original had X0 or Y0. So cases that have X4 are: 1,2,7,8,10,11,13,14. In these, the ancilla part is X4. That is not allowed because it will flip the measurement outcome. So these are discarded.
Also, could there be Y4? None here because we only got X4 from that rule. So condition A forces that the Pauli on qubit 0 must not be X or Y? Actually, wait: If the Pauli on qubit 0 is X or Y, then after gate 5, we get an X4. So for acceptance, we need that the Pauli on qubit 0 is either I or Z. So that means from the list, the only ones that can be accepted are those where the second Pauli (on qubit 0) is I or Z. That is: 
3: (I1, Z0) -&gt; final: (Z0) only.
4: (X1, I0) -&gt; final: (X1)
5: (Y1, I0) -&gt; final: (Y1)
6: (Z1, I0) -&gt; final: (Z1)
9: (X1, Z0) -&gt; final: (X1, Z0)
12: (Y1, Z0) -&gt; final: (Y1, Z0)
15: (Z1, Z0) -&gt; final: (Z1, Z0)</p>
<p>Also, what about cases where the first Pauli is I? That is already included: 3 is (I1,Z0) actually that is qubit0: Z, so okay.
So these are the candidates from gate 2 that satisfy condition A.</p>
<p>Now condition B: They must be undetectable on data. Data is qubits 0,1,2,3. These errors only act on qubits 0 and 1 (since they come from gate 2, and after propagation, they don&rsquo;t involve qubits 2 or 3 because gate 3,4,5 act on other qubits but since E2 initially only acts on 0 and 1, and gates 3 and 4 commute with that, and gate 5 only adds something on qubit 4 if needed, but condition A already forced that we don&rsquo;t have that addition actually wait: In cases like 3,4,5,6,9,12,15, there is no operator on qubit 4 because condition A required that the Pauli on qubit 0 is I or Z. So indeed, these errors are solely on qubits 0 and 1. So we need to check whether these Paulis on qubits 0 and 1 commute with both stabilizers XXXX and ZZZZ.
Let&rsquo;s check each:</p>
<p>3: (I1, Z0) -&gt; actually careful: (I1, Z0) means on qubit 1: I, on qubit 0: Z. So that is just Z0 alone.
Z0 alone: As before, Z0 anticommutes with XXXX because X0 anticommutes with Z0. So detectable. So discard.</p>
<p>4: (X1, I0) -&gt;那就是 X1 alone.
X1 alone: X1 commutes with XXXX? X1 commutes with X1 but anticommutes with ZZZZ because Z1 anticommutes with X1. So detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>5: (Y1, I0) -&gt; Y1 alone. Y1 anticommutes with both? Actually, Y1 anticommutes with X1 and Z1, so detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>6: (Z1, I0) -&gt; Z1 alone. Z1 anticommutes with XXXX (since X1 anticommutes with Z1) so detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>9: (X1, Z0) -&gt; This is X1 Z0.
Check with XXXX: XXXX = X0 X1 X2 X3. X1 Z0: Z0 anticommutes with X0, X1 commutes with X1 -&gt; so overall anticommutes? Actually, careful: The operator is on qubits 0 and 1. For it to commute with XXXX, we need an even number of qubits where the Pauli is either Z or Y. Here, qubit 0: Z (anticommutes), qubit 1: X (commutes). So that&rsquo;s 1 anticommuting -&gt; anticommutes. So detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>12: (Y1, Z0) -&gt; Y1 Z0.
Check with XXXX: qubit 0: Z -&gt; anticommutes, qubit 1: Y -&gt; anticommutes, so total anticommutation count = 2 -&gt; commutes with XXXX.
Check with ZZZZ: ZZZZ = Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3. qubit 0: Z -&gt; commutes, qubit 1: Y -&gt; anticommutes (since Y anticommutes with Z), so that gives 1 anticommutation -&gt; anticommutes with ZZZZ. So detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>15: (Z1, Z0) -&gt; Z1 Z0.
Check with XXXX: qubit 0: Z -&gt; anticommutes, qubit 1: Z -&gt; anticommutes, so that&rsquo;s 2 -&gt; commutes with XXXX.
Check with ZZZZ: qubit 0: Z -&gt; commutes, qubit 1: Z -&gt; commutes, so commutes with ZZZZ. So this is undetectable.
So from gate 2, the only accepted error is number 15: (Z1, Z0) -&gt; becomes final: (Z1, Z0) actually wait, careful: (Z1, Z0) means on qubit 1: Z, on qubit 0: Z. So that is Z0 Z1.
What is Z0 Z1 logically? Z0 Z1 is actually Z_A itself? Because Z_A = ZZII means on qubits 0 and 1: Z. So this error is Z_A. And Z_A acts on |00&gt;_L as identity because |00&gt;_L is +1 eigenstate of Z_A. So that is harmless. So gate 2 also gives no logical error that reduces fidelity.</p>
<p>Now, gate 1 errors.
Gate 1: CNOT_{12} (qubits 1 and 2). Error occurs after gate 1. Then it goes through gates 2,3,4,5.
So we need to propagate an error E1 on qubits (1,2) through gate 2 (CNOT_{10}), gate 3 (CNOT_{23}), gate 4 (CNOT_{34}), and gate 5 (CNOT_{04}).
Let&rsquo;s do that step by step.
E1 is on qubits 1 and 2. Write it as: (P1, Q2) where P,Q ∈ {I,X,Y,Z} not both I.
First, propagate through gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Gate 2 acts on qubits 1 and 0. So this will affect the part on qubit 1.
Under CNOT_{10}, the rules for operators on qubit 1 (control) are:
X_1 -&gt; X_1 X_0
Z_1 -&gt; Z_1
And for operators on qubit 0 target are as before but initially there is no operator on qubit 0 from E1 because E1 is on qubits 1 and 2 only. So after gate 2, the error becomes:
For E1 = (P1, Q2):
If P1 = I: then it remains (I1, Q2) but careful: actually, if P1=I, then it&rsquo;s (I1, Q2) and gate 2 does nothing because it acts on qubit 1 and 0, but if qubit 1 is I, then it&rsquo;s identity there. So remains (I1, Q2).
If P1 = X: then X_1 -&gt; X_1 X_0. So becomes: (X1 X0, Q2) so now involved qubit 0 appears.
If P1 = Y: then Y_1 -&gt; Y_1 X_0 (as before, since control Y becomes Y_1 X_0).
If P1 = Z: then Z_1 remains Z_1. So becomes: (Z1, Q2).</p>
<p>So after gate 2, let&rsquo;s denote this as E1^{(2)}.
Next, propagate through gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Gate 3 acts on qubits 2 and 3. This will affect the part on qubit 2.
Now, after gate 2, E1^{(2)} could involve qubits 1,0,2. Gate 3 acts on qubits 2 and 3. So it will affect any Pauli on qubit 2. The rules for CNOT_{23}:
On control qubit 2: 
X_2 -&gt; X_2 X_3
Z_2 -&gt; Z_2
On target qubit 3: 
X_3 -&gt; X_3
Z_3 -&gt; Z_2 Z_3
But initially, there is no operator on qubit 3 yet. So after gate 3, the transformation on the Pauli on qubit 2 will be:
If the Pauli on qubit 2 is I -&gt; remains I.
If it is X -&gt; becomes: X_2 X_3.
If it is Y -&gt; becomes: Y_2 X_3 (since Y_2 -&gt; Y_2 X_3)
If it is Z -&gt; remains Z_2.
And this will happen regardless of what else is there because these act on different qubits (qubits 0 and 1 are not affected by gate 3).
So after gate 3, we get E1^{(3)}.
Next, propagate through gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. This will affect any Pauli on qubit 3 that might have appeared from previous steps.
After gate 3, E1^{(3)} could involve qubits 0,1,2,3. Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. So it will affect any Pauli on qubit 3. The rules for CNOT_{34}:
On control qubit 3:
X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4
Z_3 -&gt; Z_3
On target qubit 4:
X_4 -&gt; X_4
Z_4 -&gt; Z_3 Z_4
After gate 4, we get E1^{(4)}.
Finally, propagate through gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Gate 5 acts on qubits 0 and 4. This will affect any Pauli on qubit 0 and qubit 4.
After gate 4, E1^{(4)} could involve qubits 0,1,2,3,4. Gate 5 will affect Paulis on qubit 0 and 4 as before.</p>
<p>This is getting quite involved. We need to go through each of the 15 errors for gate 1 and compute their final form. But maybe we can be systematic. Let&rsquo;s list the 15 errors for gate 1. They are on qubits (1,2). I will go through each and compute step by step.</p>
<p>Let E1 = (P1, Q2). I will go through each combination of P and Q (non-identity). I&rsquo;ll make a table.</p>
<p>I will denote the steps as: 
After gate 1 error: E1 itself.
Then after gate 2: apply conjugation by CNOT_{10}. 
Then after gate 3: apply conjugation by CNOT_{23}.
Then after gate 4: apply conjugation by CNOT_{34}.
Then after gate 5: apply conjugation by CNOT_{04}.</p>
<p>I will keep track of the Pauli on each qubit: qubits 0,1,2,3,4. Initially, only qubits 1 and 2 have something.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this case by case.</p>
<p>Case 1: E1 = (X1, I2). So that is: qubit1: X, qubit2: I.
Step: Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. acts on qubits 1 and 0. On qubit1, we have X. Under CNOT_{10}, X_1 -&gt; X_1 X_0. So this becomes: (X1 X0, I2). So after gate 2: qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: I.
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. acts on qubits 2 and 3. Currently, no operator on qubit2 because it&rsquo;s I. So remains same: (X0, X1, I2) actually careful: It is X0 X1 on qubits 0 and 1, and I2.
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. acts on qubits 3 and 4. No operator on qubit3 yet. So remains: (X0, X1) on qubits 0 and 1.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. acts on qubits 0 and 4. Now, qubit0 has X. Under CNOT_{04}, for control qubit 0: X_0 -&gt; X_0 X_4. So that becomes: X0 -&gt; becomes X0 X4. So after gate 5, we get: qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit4: X.
So final for case 1: E1_final = X0 X1 X4.
Now conditions:
Condition A: Ancilla: qubit4 has X4 -&gt; not allowed (X4 will flip measurement). So discard.</p>
<p>Case 2: E1 = (Y1, I2). So: qubit1: Y, qubit2: I.
Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. On qubit1, Y_1 -&gt; Y_1 X_0 (since control Y becomes Y_1 X_0). So becomes: (Y1 X0, I2) -&gt; so qubit0: X, qubit1: Y.
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. No change because qubit2 is I.
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. No change because no qubit3.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Now, qubit0 has X. Under CNOT_{04}, for control, X_0 -&gt; X_0 X_4. So then qubit0: X becomes X0 X4. So overall becomes: qubit0: X, qubit1: Y, qubit4: X (from that multiplication? careful: We had product: Y1 * X0. After gate 5, X0 becomes X0 X4, so product becomes Y1 * X0 X4 = X0 Y1 X4). So final: X0 Y1 X4.
Condition A: Ancilla: qubit4 has X4 -&gt; not allowed. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 3: E1 = (Z1, I2). So: qubit1: Z, qubit2: I.
Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. On qubit1, Z_1 is invariant because control Z remains Z. So remains: (Z1, I2).
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. No change.
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. No change.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Now, no operator on qubit0 initially? Actually, careful: After gate 2, we have only Z1. So remains Z1.
So final: Z1 only.
Condition A: Okay because no ancilla action.
Condition B: Z1 alone on data. Z1 alone: anticommutes with XXXX because X1 anticommutes with Z1. So detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 4: E1 = (I1, X2). So: qubit1: I, qubit2: X.
Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. No change because qubit1 is I.
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. On qubit2, X_2 -&gt; X_2 X_3 (since control X becomes X_2 X_3). So becomes: (I1, X2 X3) -&gt; so qubit2: X, qubit3: X.
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Now, qubit3 has X. Under CNOT_{34}, for control qubit 3? Actually careful: Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. qubit3 has X. Under CNOT_{34}, for control, X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4. So that becomes: X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So then overall becomes: qubit2: X, qubit3: X, qubit4: X. So after gate 4: X2 X3 X4.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. acts on qubits 0 and 4. Now, qubit4 has X. Under CNOT_{04}, for target, X_4 is invariant actually wait: For target, X_4 -&gt; X_4 (unchanged). So remains: X2 X3 X4.
So final: X2 X3 X4.
Condition A: Ancilla: qubit4 has X4 -&gt; not allowed. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 5: E1 = (I1, Y2). So: qubit1: I, qubit2: Y.
Gate 2: No change.
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. On qubit2, Y_2 -&gt; Y_2 X_3. So becomes: (I1, Y2 X3) -&gt; so qubit2: Y, qubit3: X.
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Now, qubit3 has X. Under CNOT_{34}, for control, X_3 -&gt; X_3 X_4. So then becomes: qubit2: Y, qubit3: X, qubit4: X -&gt; actually careful: We have Y2 * X3. After gate 4, X3 becomes X3 X4, so product becomes Y2 * X3 X4 = X3 Y2 X4? But careful with order: They commute since acting on different qubits. So final after gate 4: Y2 X3 X4.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. acts on qubits 0 and 4. qubit4 has X. Under CNOT_{04}, for target, X_4 is invariant. So remains: Y2 X3 X4.
Condition A: Ancilla: qubit4 has X4 -&gt; not allowed. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 6: E1 = (I1, Z2). So: qubit1: I, qubit2: Z.
Gate 2: No change.
Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. On qubit2, Z_2 is invariant (control Z remains Z). So remains: (I1, Z2).
Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. No change because no qubit3 involvement? Actually, careful: Gate 4 acts on qubits 3 and 4. Z2 commutes with that. So remains: Z2.
Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. No change because no qubit0 or4 involvement? Actually, careful: Z2 is on qubit2 only, so it commutes with gate 5. So final: Z2 only.
Condition A: Okay.
Condition B: Z2 alone on data. Z2 alone: anticommutes with XXXX because X2 anticommutes with Z2. So detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 7: E1 = (X1, X2). So: qubit1: X, qubit2: X.
Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. On qubit</p>

                      <div class="markdown-body reasoning-body">
                        <p>First, I need to find the logical state fidelity as a function of p. From my reasoning, I was evaluating errors from each CNOT gate to see which ones cause logical errors after post-selection. I looked at gates 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 separately.</p>
<p>From gate 5, no errors lead to a logical error; they are either no error or harmless (like I0 Z4).</p>
<p>From gate 4, the only undetectable error was Z3 Z4, which propagated to Z0 Z3 Z4, and Z0 Z3 is equivalent to Z_A Z_B, which acts as identity on |00⟩_L, so harmless.</p>
<p>From gate 3, the only undetectable error was Z2 Z3, which is Z2 Z3, and that acts as identity on |00⟩_L, so harmless.</p>
<p>From gate 2, the only undetectable error was Z1 Z0, which is Z_A, and that acts as identity on |00⟩_L, so harmless.</p>
<p>Now, from gate 1, I started analyzing cases. I need to continue with gate 1 errors because that might have logical errors that reduce fidelity.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of case analysis for gate 1 errors. Let me list all cases for gate 1:</p>
<p>E1 on qubits (1,2) with Paulis P1 and Q2, not both identity.</p>
<p>I did cases 1 to 6:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(X1, I2) -&gt; final: X0 X1 X4 -&gt; fails condition A due to X4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Y1, I2) -&gt; final: X0 Y1 X4 -&gt; fails condition A due to X4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Z1, I2) -&gt; final: Z1 -&gt; detectable, fails condition B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(I1, X2) -&gt; final: X2 X3 X4 -&gt; fails condition A due to X4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(I1, Y2) -&gt; final: Y2 X3 X4 -&gt; fails condition A due to X4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(I1, Z2) -&gt; final: Z2 -&gt; detectable, fails condition B.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, case 7: (X1, X2)</p>
<p>E1 = (X1, X2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10} affects qubit1. X1 -&gt; X1 X0. So becomes (X1 X0, X2) -&gt; so qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: X.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23} affects qubit2. X2 -&gt; X2 X3. So becomes: qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: X, qubit3: X? Wait, careful: After gate 2, we have X0 X1 and X2. Under gate 3, X2 -&gt; X2 X3, so now product is X0 X1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34} affects qubit3. X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So becomes: X0 X1 X2 X3 X4? Actually, X3 becomes X3 X4, so overall X0 X1 X2 (X3 X4) = X0 X1 X2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04} affects qubit0 and qubit4. Now, qubit0 has X, and qubit4 has X. Under CNOT_{04}, for control qubit0, X0 -&gt; X0 X4. But careful: We have X0 and X4 already. Let&rsquo;s do it step by step.</p>
<p>After gate 4, we have operator: X0 X1 X2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Now gate 5: CNOT_{04} conjugation. This operator acts on all qubits. We need to conjugate each part separately, but since they commute, we can handle the Paulis on qubit0 and qubit4 together.</p>
<p>CNOT_{04} conjugates:</p>
<p>X0 -&gt; X0 X4</p>
<p>X4 -&gt; X4 (since target X is unchanged)</p>
<p>But wait, we have both X0 and X4 in the product. So under conjugation, X0 becomes X0 X4, and X4 remains X4. So the product X0 X4 becomes (X0 X4) * X4 = X0 X4^2 = X0, since X4^2 = I. Is that correct?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think carefully. When conjugating a product, we conjugate each Pauli separately. So for the operator O = X0 X1 X2 X3 X4, we compute U^\dagger O U where U = CNOT_{04}.</p>
<p>U^\dagger X0 U = X0 X4  (since control X)</p>
<p>U^\dagger X1 U = X1 (not affected)</p>
<p>U^\dagger X2 U = X2</p>
<p>U^\dagger X3 U = X3</p>
<p>U^\dagger X4 U = X4 (target X unchanged)</p>
<p>So overall, U^\dagger O U = (X0 X4) X1 X2 X3 X4 = X0 X1 X2 X3 X4 X4? No, careful with multiplication order. Since they act on different qubits, they commute, so it&rsquo;s X0 X1 X2 X3 (X4 X4) but X4 X4 = I, so actually U^\dagger O U = X0 X1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Because (X0 X4) X4 = X0 (X4 X4) = X0.</p>
<p>So after gate 5, the final operator is X0 X1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Now, condition A: This acts only on data qubits, no ancilla involvement, so ancilla is I, which is fine.</p>
<p>Condition B: On data, X0 X1 X2 X3. But the stabilizer is XXXX, which is X0 X1 X2 X3. So this is exactly the stabilizer S1. Therefore, it is undetectable and acts as identity on the code space. So harmless.</p>
<p>So case 7 is harmless.</p>
<p>Case 8: (X1, Y2)</p>
<p>E1 = (X1, Y2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. X1 -&gt; X1 X0. So becomes (X1 X0, Y2) -&gt; so qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: Y.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. Y2 -&gt; Y2 X3. So becomes: qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: Y, qubit3: X? After gate 3: product is X0 X1 * (Y2 X3) = X0 X1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Affects qubit3. X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So becomes: X0 X1 Y2 (X3 X4) = X0 X1 Y2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate each:</p>
<p>U^\dagger X0 U = X0 X4</p>
<p>U^\dagger X1 U = X1</p>
<p>U^\dagger Y2 U = Y2</p>
<p>U^\dagger X3 U = X3</p>
<p>U^\dagger X4 U = X4</p>
<p>So overall: (X0 X4) X1 Y2 X3 X4 = X0 X1 Y2 X3 X4 X4 = X0 X1 Y2 X3, since X4^2=I.</p>
<p>So final: X0 X1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>Condition A: No ancilla, so okay.</p>
<p>Condition B: On data, X0 X1 Y2 X3. Check with stabilizers.</p>
<p>XXXX: X0 X1 X2 X3. Our operator has X0, X1, Y2, X3. Y2 anticommutes with X2, so with XXXX, the anticommutation comes from Y2 vs X2? But XXXX has X2, and Y2 anticommutes with X2, so overall, X0 X1 Y2 X3 and X0 X1 X2 X3 will anticommute because Y2 and X2 anticommute. So this anticommutes with XXXX, hence detectable. So discard.</p>
<p>Case 9: (X1, Z2)</p>
<p>E1 = (X1, Z2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. X1 -&gt; X1 X0. So becomes (X1 X0, Z2) -&gt; qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: Z.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. Z2 is invariant under CNOT_{23} because control Z remains Z. So remains: X0 X1 Z2.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. No effect on Z2 or others, so remains X0 X1 Z2.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate: U^\dagger X0 U = X0 X4, U^\dagger X1 U = X1, U^\dagger Z2 U = Z2. So overall: (X0 X4) X1 Z2 = X0 X1 Z2 X4.</p>
<p>Condition A: Ancilla has X4, which is not allowed. So discard.</p>
<p>Case 10: (Y1, X2)</p>
<p>E1 = (Y1, X2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Y1 -&gt; Y1 X0. So becomes (Y1 X0, X2) -&gt; qubit0: X, qubit1: Y, qubit2: X.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. X2 -&gt; X2 X3. So becomes: Y1 X0 * (X2 X3) = X0 Y1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Affects qubit3. X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So becomes: X0 Y1 X2 (X3 X4) = X0 Y1 X2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate: U^\dagger X0 U = X0 X4, U^\dagger Y1 U = Y1, U^\dagger X2 U = X2, U^\dagger X3 U = X3, U^\dagger X4 U = X4.</p>
<p>So overall: (X0 X4) Y1 X2 X3 X4 = X0 Y1 X2 X3 X4 X4 = X0 Y1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Final: X0 Y1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Condition A: No ancilla, okay.</p>
<p>Condition B: On data, X0 Y1 X2 X3. Check with XXXX: X0 X1 X2 X3. Y1 anticommutes with X1, so this anticommutes with XXXX. Detectable. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 11: (Y1, Y2)</p>
<p>E1 = (Y1, Y2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Y1 -&gt; Y1 X0. So becomes (Y1 X0, Y2) -&gt; qubit0: X, qubit1: Y, qubit2: Y.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. Y2 -&gt; Y2 X3. So becomes: Y1 X0 * (Y2 X3) = X0 Y1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Affects qubit3. X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So becomes: X0 Y1 Y2 (X3 X4) = X0 Y1 Y2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate: U^\dagger X0 U = X0 X4, U^\dagger Y1 U = Y1, U^\dagger Y2 U = Y2, U^\dagger X3 U = X3, U^\dagger X4 U = X4.</p>
<p>So overall: (X0 X4) Y1 Y2 X3 X4 = X0 Y1 Y2 X3 X4 X4 = X0 Y1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>Final: X0 Y1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>Condition A: Okay.</p>
<p>Condition B: On data, X0 Y1 Y2 X3. Check with XXXX: X0 X1 X2 X3. Y1 anticommutes with X1, Y2 anticommutes with X2, so two anticommutations, so commutes with XXXX? Let&rsquo;s check: XXXX * (X0 Y1 Y2 X3) = since X0 and X3 commute, but with X1 and X2, Y1 anticommutes with X1, Y2 anticommutes with X2, so overall sign (-1)*(-1)=1, so commutes with XXXX.</p>
<p>Now check with ZZZZ: Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3. Our operator has X0, Y1, Y2, X3. X0 anticommutes with Z0, Y1 anticommutes with Z1, Y2 anticommutes with Z2, X3 anticommutes with Z3? X3 and Z3 anticommute. So that&rsquo;s four anticommutations, so commutes with ZZZZ? Because each pair anticommutes, but since there are four, the product of signs is (-1)^4 =1, so commutes. So this is undetectable.</p>
<p>Now, is it harmless or logical? This is X0 Y1 Y2 X3. We need to see its action on |00⟩_L.</p>
<p>This looks like it could be a logical operator. Let&rsquo;s see what logical operator this might be. The given logical operators are X_A = XIXI, which is X1, wait no: X_A = XIXI means on qubit1: X, qubit0: I? The problem says: X_A = XIXI, but careful with qubit labels. The physical qubits are 0,1,2,3. So XIXI means qubit0: X, qubit1: I, qubit2: X, qubit3: I? No, typically Pauli strings are written in order of qubits. So XIXI would be for qubits 0,1,2,3: X on 0, I on 1, X on 2, I on 3? But the problem says: &ldquo;X_A = XIXI&rdquo;, but it might be that the first symbol is for qubit0? The problem says: &ldquo;X_A = XIXI&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;X_B = XXII&rdquo;. So likely, the string is for qubits 0,1,2,3 in that order. So X_A = XIXI means qubit0: X, qubit1: I, qubit2: X, qubit3: I? But that would be X0 X2, but wait, the problem says &ldquo;X_A = XIXI&rdquo;, which might be read as X on qubit0, I on qubit1, X on qubit2, I on qubit3? But then X_B = XXII would be X on qubit0, X on qubit1, I on qubit2, I on qubit3? But that seems odd because then both involve qubit0. Let&rsquo;s read the problem carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The logical X and Z operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, for <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, this likely means: for qubit0: X, qubit1: I, qubit2: X, qubit3: I? But then <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span> would be qubit0: X, qubit1: X, qubit2: I, qubit3: I. Similarly, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A=ZZII\)</span> would be qubit0: Z, qubit1: Z, qubit2: I, qubit3: I, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B=ZIZI\)</span> would be qubit0: Z, qubit1: I, qubit2: Z, qubit3: I.</p>
<p>But in my earlier analysis, I was using Z_A = ZZII as on qubits 0 and 1, which matches if II means qubits 2 and 3 are I. So yes, the order is qubit0,1,2,3.</p>
<p>So X_A = X0 I1 X2 I3? But that would be X0 X2, but the string is XIXI, which has four letters, so position 1: X, position 2: I, position 3: X, position 4: I? But then that would be for qubits 1,2,3,4? But we have qubits 0,1,2,3. I think there might be an off-by-one error in the problem statement regarding labels.</p>
<p>Look: &ldquo;Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3.&rdquo; So qubits are 0,1,2,3.</p>
<p>Then &ldquo;X_A = XIXI&rdquo; – this likely means that the first character corresponds to qubit0, second to qubit1, third to qubit2, fourth to qubit3. So X_A = X on qubit0, I on qubit1, X on qubit2, I on qubit3. But that would be X0 X2.</p>
<p>Similarly, X_B = XXII means X on qubit0, X on qubit1, I on qubit2, I on qubit3, so X0 X1.</p>
<p>Z_A = ZZII means Z on qubit0, Z on qubit1, I on qubit2, I on qubit3, so Z0 Z1.</p>
<p>Z_B = ZIZI means Z on qubit0, I on qubit1, Z on qubit2, I on qubit3, so Z0 Z2.</p>
<p>But in my earlier, I had Z_A = ZZII as on qubits 0 and 1, which is correct, and Z_B = ZIZI on qubits 0 and 2, which is correct.</p>
<p>But for X_A, it should be on qubits that anticommute with Z_A. Z_A = Z0 Z1, so X_A should anticommute with Z0 Z1, so X_A could be X0 or X1 or something. But if X_A = X0 X2, does it anticommute with Z0 Z1? X0 X2 anticommutes with Z0 but commutes with Z1, so overall anticommutes with Z0 Z1, good. Similarly, X_B should anticommute with Z_B. Z_B = Z0 Z2, so X_B should anticommute with that, so X_B = X0 X1 would anticommute with Z0 but commute with Z2? X0 X1 and Z0 Z2: X0 anticommutes with Z0, X1 commutes with Z2, so overall anticommutes, good.</p>
<p>So yes, X_A = X0 X2 and X_B = X0 X1.</p>
<p>But in the problem, it is written as XIXI and XXII. XIXI would be read as: if positions are qubit0,1,2,3, then X, I, X, I so X0 X2. And XXII would be X, X, I, I so X0 X1. So that makes sense.</p>
<p>Similarly, Z_A = ZZII is Z0 Z1, and Z_B = ZIZI is Z0 Z2.</p>
<p>So in my analysis, when I have operators on data, I need to compare with these logical operators.</p>
<p>Back to case 11: final operator is X0 Y1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>This acts on all data qubits. We need to see if it is a logical operator and what it does to |00⟩_L.</p>
<p>First, check if it commutes with stabilizers. We did that: it commutes with XXXX and ZZZZ, so undetectable.</p>
<p>Now, is it a stabilizer? Stabilizers are XXXX and ZZZZ and their products. X0 Y1 Y2 X3 is not obviously a stabilizer because stabilizers have all X or all Z. So it must be a logical operator.</p>
<p>Now, what logical operator is it? Let&rsquo;s see its action on the logical basis.</p>
<p>Since |00⟩_L is the +1 eigenstate of Z_A and Z_B, i.e., Z0 Z1 and Z0 Z2.</p>
<p>Compute the commutator with Z_A = Z0 Z1.</p>
<p>X0 Y1 Y2 X3 and Z0 Z1: 
Z0 anticommutes with X0, so that gives -1 for Z0 part.
Z1 anticommutes with Y1, so another -1, so overall commutes? Because two anticommutations give sign (+1). So it commutes with Z_A.</p>
<p>Now with Z_B = Z0 Z2.
Z0 anticommutes with X0, so -1.
Z2 anticommutes with Y2, so -1, so commutes with Z_B.</p>
<p>So this operator commutes with both Z_A and Z_B. That means it should act as identity or phase on |00⟩_L? Since |00⟩_L is stabilized by Z_A and Z_B, any operator that commutes with them will act as a scalar on |00⟩_L. So let&rsquo;s find its eigenvalue on |00⟩_L.</p>
<p>|00⟩_L = (|0000⟩ + |1111⟩)/√2.</p>
<p>Apply X0 Y1 Y2 X3 to |0000⟩.
X0 Y1 Y2 X3 |0000⟩ = X0 |0⟩ Y1 |0⟩ Y2 |0⟩ X3 |0⟩ = |1⟩ * (i|1⟩) * (i|1⟩) * |0⟩? Let&rsquo;s compute carefully.</p>
<p>Y|0⟩ = i|1⟩ because Y = iσ_y, and σ_y|0⟩ = i|1⟩? Actually, standard Pauli Y: Y|0⟩ = i|1⟩? Wait, in quantum computing, often Y is defined such that Y|0⟩ = i|1⟩ and Y|1⟩ = -i|0⟩. But since we care about phase up to global, perhaps we need to be careful.</p>
<p>X0 |0⟩ = |1⟩
Y1 |0⟩ = i|1⟩ for qubit1
Y2 |0⟩ = i|1⟩ for qubit2
X3 |0⟩ = |1⟩ for qubit3
So product: |1⟩ ⊗ (i|1⟩) ⊗ (i|1⟩) ⊗ |1⟩ = i * i |1111⟩ = - |1111⟩</p>
<p>Now apply to |1111⟩:
X0 Y1 Y2 X3 |1111⟩ = X0|1⟩ Y1|1⟩ Y2|1⟩ X3|1⟩ = |0⟩ * (-i|0⟩) * (-i|0⟩) * |0⟩ = (-i)<em>(-i) |0000⟩ = (-1) |0000⟩? Because (-i)</em>(-i) = i^2 = -1.
So |0000⟩ becomes -|0000⟩?</p>
<p>So overall, X0 Y1 Y2 X3 (|0000⟩ + |1111⟩) = -|1111⟩ + (-|0000⟩) = - (|0000⟩ + |1111⟩) = - |00⟩_L.</p>
<p>So it acts as -1 on |00⟩_L. That means it is actually the identity up to a phase? But -1 is a global phase, so the state is unchanged. Therefore, this error is harmless because it only adds a global phase.</p>
<p>So case 11 is harmless.</p>
<p>Case 12: (Y1, Z2)</p>
<p>E1 = (Y1, Z2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Y1 -&gt; Y1 X0. So becomes (Y1 X0, Z2) -&gt; qubit0: X, qubit1: Y, qubit2: Z.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. Z2 is invariant. So remains: X0 Y1 Z2.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. No change, so X0 Y1 Z2.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate: U^\dagger X0 U = X0 X4, U^\dagger Y1 U = Y1, U^\dagger Z2 U = Z2. So overall: (X0 X4) Y1 Z2 = X0 Y1 Z2 X4.</p>
<p>Condition A: Ancilla has X4, not allowed. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 13: (Z1, X2)</p>
<p>E1 = (Z1, X2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Z1 is invariant. So remains (Z1, X2) -&gt; qubit1: Z, qubit2: X.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. X2 -&gt; X2 X3. So becomes: Z1 * (X2 X3) = Z1 X2 X3.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Affects qubit3. X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So becomes: Z1 X2 (X3 X4) = Z1 X2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate: U^\dagger Z1 U = Z1, U^\dagger X2 U = X2, U^\dagger X3 U = X3, U^\dagger X4 U = X4. So remains: Z1 X2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Condition A: Ancilla has X4, not allowed. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 14: (Z1, Y2)</p>
<p>E1 = (Z1, Y2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Z1 invariant. So remains (Z1, Y2) -&gt; qubit1: Z, qubit2: Y.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. Y2 -&gt; Y2 X3. So becomes: Z1 * (Y2 X3) = Z1 Y2 X3.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. Affects qubit3. X3 -&gt; X3 X4. So becomes: Z1 Y2 (X3 X4) = Z1 Y2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. Conjugate: U^\dagger Z1 U = Z1, U^\dagger Y2 U = Y2, U^\dagger X3 U = X3, U^\dagger X4 U = X4. So remains: Z1 Y2 X3 X4.</p>
<p>Condition A: Ancilla has X4, not allowed. Discard.</p>
<p>Case 15: (Z1, Z2)</p>
<p>E1 = (Z1, Z2)</p>
<p>Gate 2: CNOT_{10}. Z1 invariant. So remains (Z1, Z2) -&gt; qubit1: Z, qubit2: Z.</p>
<p>Gate 3: CNOT_{23}. Affects qubit2. Z2 invariant. So remains Z1 Z2.</p>
<p>Gate 4: CNOT_{34}. No change, so Z1 Z2.</p>
<p>Gate 5: CNOT_{04}. No change, so Z1 Z2.</p>
<p>Final: Z1 Z2.</p>
<p>Condition A: No ancilla, okay.</p>
<p>Condition B: On data, Z1 Z2. Check with stabilizers. Z1 Z2: with XXXX, Z1 anticommutes with X1, Z2 anticommutes with X2, so two anticommutations, commutes with XXXX. With ZZZZ, Z1 and Z2 commute with Z1 and Z2, so commutes. So undetectable.</p>
<p>Now, what is Z1 Z2 logically? From earlier, Z1 Z2 is actually Z_A Z_B? Because Z_A = Z0 Z1, Z_B = Z0 Z2, so Z_A Z_B = Z0 Z1 Z0 Z2 = Z1 Z2. So this is the product of Z_A and Z_B. And since |00⟩_L is eigenvector of both with +1, it is also eigenvector of Z1 Z2 with +1. So harmless.</p>
<p>So from gate 1, all errors either are detected or are harmless. That means that to first order, there are no errors that cause a logical error after post-selection.</p>
<p>But wait, that can&rsquo;t be right because then the fidelity would be 1 to first order, but that seems too good to be true. I might have missed something.</p>
<p>Perhaps errors from different gates can combine, but since we are only considering first order, we only consider single errors. So if no single error causes a logical error, then the infidelity is order p^2 or higher.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s double-check if there is any error that causes a logical error. From gate 1, case 8 was detectable, case 11 was harmless, others were detected or harmless. What about case? I think I covered all.</p>
<p>Perhaps from other gates, but I already did gates 2,3,4,5 and found no logical errors.</p>
<p>So it seems that for single errors, after post-selection, the state is always correct. Therefore, the logical fidelity should be 1 to first order in p. But wait, the post-selection itself might reduce the success probability, but the fidelity conditional on success is 1.</p>
<p>But is that possible? Let&rsquo;s think about the circuit. This is a fault-tolerant preparation circuit for the |00⟩ state in the [[4,2,2]] code. Since the code has distance 2, it can detect any single error. And the circuit is designed to be fault-tolerant, so likely single errors are detected and post-selected away, so that only states with no errors or errors that are stabilizers remain, and stabilizers don&rsquo;t change the state. So yes, it makes sense that to first order, the fidelity is 1.</p>
<p>But the question asks for the logical state fidelity as a function of p. Since to first order it is 1, we need to consider higher orders? But the problem might expect an expression in terms of p, and since no first-order term, perhaps it is 1 - O(p^2) or something.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s confirm with the ancilla measurement. In all cases, when an error occurred that was undetectable, the ancilla measurement was always 0 because we enforced that in condition A. So yes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the logical fidelity F should be 1 for small p, but since there might be higher-order terms, but the problem likely expects the leading order expression. Often in such problems, the fidelity is 1 - c p^2 + &hellip; but since I only computed first order, and first order is 0, perhaps the answer is 1.</p>
<p>But wait, the problem says &ldquo;what is the logical state fidelity&rdquo;, and it might be that we need to compute the probability that the state is correct given success, which to first order is 1.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think about the probability of success. The probability that no error occurs is (1-p)^5. But also, when errors occur that are stabilizers, they are also accepted. So the success probability includes those. But for fidelity, we care about the state being correct, which includes both no error and stabilizer errors.</p>
<p>So the fidelity F = (probability of no error + probability of harmless errors) / (probability of success).</p>
<p>But since to first order, the only errors that are accepted are harmless, the fidelity should be 1 to first order.</p>
<p>But perhaps there is a first-order term because some errors are accepted but are logical errors? But from my analysis, I didn&rsquo;t find any single error that is accepted and logical. So I think fidelity is 1 - O(p^2).</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s check gate 1 case 11 again: that was harmless because it gave a phase. So yes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the logical fidelity is 1 to first order in p.</p>
<p>But the problem might expect an exact expression, but since the error model is depolarizing, and we have multiple gates, the exact expression would be complicated. Probably, they want the leading order behavior.</p>
<p>Perhaps I missed an error. What about errors on the Hadamard gate? The problem only mentions errors on CNOT gates, not on Hadamard or measurement. So only CNOT gates have errors.</p>
<p>So with 5 CNOT gates, each with error probability p, the probability of no error is (1-p)^5, and probability of any error is 1-(1-p)^5 ≈ 5p for small p, but all those errors are detected or harmless, so fidelity remains 1.</p>
<p>But wait, when an error occurs, it might be detected by the ancilla measurement or by the stabilizer measurement. So those cases are post-selected out. So the success probability is reduced, but the fidelity conditional on success is 1 to first order.</p>
<p>Therefore, the logical state fidelity F(p) = 1 for all p? That can&rsquo;t be right because for large p, it should drop, but for small p, it should be close to 1.</p>
<p>Perhaps for single errors, it is indeed 1, but for two errors, there might be logical errors that are not detected. So the infidelity would be of order p^2.</p>
<p>But the problem asks for fidelity as a function of p, likely expecting an expression up to first order or something. But since first order is 1, perhaps the answer is simply 1.</p>
<p>But that seems odd. Let me read the problem again: &ldquo;What is the logical state fidelity of the final 2-qubit logical state at the end of the circuit as a function of two-qubit gate error rate p&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;assuming the state is post-selected on all detectable errors and on the ancilla qubit measuring |0⟩&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after post-selection, the state should be in the code space and ancilla |0⟩, and we want the fidelity with |00⟩_L.</p>
<p>From my analysis, for any single error, if it is accepted, it is because it is undetectable and acts as identity on |00⟩_L. So yes, fidelity is 1 for single errors.</p>
<p>Therefore, the leading error would be from two errors that cancel each other&rsquo;s detection but still cause a logical error. So the infidelity would be order p^2.</p>
<p>But the problem might expect the expression to first order in p, which is 1.</p>
<p>Perhaps for this specific circuit, there are no first-order logical errors.</p>
<p>So I think the logical fidelity is 1 - O(p^2).</p>
<p>But since the problem likely expects a function of p, and since no first-order term, perhaps the answer is 1.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see if there is any first-order term from somewhere else.</p>
<p>What about errors on the initial state? We assumed initial state is perfect. Also, Hadamard is perfect. So only CNOT errors.</p>
<p>So I think for this setup, fidelity is 1 to first order.</p>
<p>Therefore, the logical state fidelity F(p) = 1 for small p.</p>
<p>But to be precise, since the question says &ldquo;as a function of two-qubit gate error rate p&rdquo;, perhaps we need to write it as 1.</p>
<p>But wait, could it be that some errors are accepted but are logical? Let&rsquo;s think about gate 1 case 8: that was detectable, so not accepted. Case 11 harmless. What about gate 2? I had only case 15 which is harmless. Gate 3 case 4c harmless. Gate 4 case 15 harmless. Gate 5 only I0Z4 which is harmless.</p>
<p>So indeed, no single error causes a logical error after post-selection.</p>
<p>So I believe the logical fidelity is 1.</p>
<p>But perhaps the fidelity is not 1 but something else because of the way we calculate it. Fidelity is the overlap, and since the state is always |00⟩_L after post-selection for single errors, yes.</p>
<p>So for the purpose of this problem, the answer should be that the logical state fidelity is 1.</p>
<p>But that seems too trivial. Maybe I missed an error that is accepted and logical.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider gate 1 case 8 again: (X1, Y2) became X0 X1 Y2 X3 after gate 5, which anticommutes with XXXX, so it is detectable. So not accepted.</p>
<p>What about if an error occurs on a gate that then gets propagated to a logical operator that is not identity on |00⟩? For example, an error that gives X_A would flip the state to |10⟩_L, which would reduce fidelity. But from where could that come?</p>
<p>Suppose from gate 2, if we had an error that gives X0 X1, but from gate 2, when I did, case like (X1, I0) would give X1 only, which is detectable. Or (I1, X0) would give X0 only, detectable. Or (X1, X0) would give X0 X1 X4, which has X4, so not accepted. So no.</p>
<p>From gate 1, what would give X_A = X0 X2? For that, we need an error that results in X0 X2 on data. From gate 1, if we have (I1, X2) but that gave X2 X3 X4, not accepted. Or (X1, I2) gave X0 X1 X4, not accepted. Or (X1, X2) gave X0 X1 X2 X3, which is stabilizer, harmless. So no.</p>
<p>What about X_B = X0 X1? Similarly, not from single error.</p>
<p>So indeed, no single error gives a logical error that changes the state.</p>
<p>Therefore, the logical fidelity is 1 to first order.</p>
<p>Thus, the function should be F(p) = 1.</p>
<p>But perhaps for the sake of the problem, we need to output that.</p>
<p>Maybe the fidelity is not 1 but involves the probability of error terms, but since we post-select, the fidelity is 1.</p>
<p>So I think the answer is 1.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see the output format: it should be a SymPy expression. So probably F_logical = 1.</p>
<p>But wait, could it be that there is a first-order term because of the way the post-selection works? For example, when an error occurs, it might reduce the success probability, but the fidelity conditional on success is still 1.</p>
<p>So yes.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will set F_logical = 1.</p>
<p>So in the code, I return 1.</p>
<p>But that seems too simple. Perhaps I need to consider that the state might have a phase, but fidelity is unaffected by global phase.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s correct.</p>

                    </details>
<div class="content markdown-body"><p>Based on the analysis of the state preparation circuit for the [[4,2,2]] code with two-qubit depolarizing errors on CNOT gates, it is determined that any single error that passes post-selection (ancilla measurement |0⟩ and undetectable by code stabilizers) results in a logical state that is identical to the ideal |00⟩_L state up to a global phase. This is because all such errors act as stabilizers or identity on the logical state. Therefore, to first order in the error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, the logical state fidelity is 1. Higher-order terms (e.g., two errors) may reduce fidelity, but the problem likely requires the leading-order expression.</p>
