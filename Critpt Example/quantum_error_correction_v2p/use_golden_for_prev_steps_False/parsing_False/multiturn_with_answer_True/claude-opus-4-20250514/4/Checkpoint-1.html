    <div class="content markdown-body"><h1 id="problem-setup">Problem setup:</h1>
<p>In quantum error correction, you encode quantum states into logical states made of many qubits in order to improve their resilience to errors. In quantum error detection, you do the same but can only detect the presence of errors and not correct them. In this problem, we will consider a single [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code, which encodes two logical qubits into four physical qubits, and investigate how robust logical quantum operations in this code are to quantum errors.</p>
<p>Our convention is that the four physical qubits in the [[4,2,2]] code are labelled 0,1,2,3. The two logical qubits are labelled A and B. The stabilizers are <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> are Pauli matrices. The logical <span class="arithmatex">\(X\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> operators on the two qubits are <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B=XXII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span>, up to multiplication by stabilizers.</p>
<p>We will consider different state preparation circuits consisting of controlled not <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gates, where <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> has control qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(i\)</span> and target qubit <span class="arithmatex">\(j\)</span>. As a simple model of quantum errors in hardware, we will suppose that each <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{ij}\)</span> gate in the circuit has a two qubit depolarizing error channel following it that produces one of the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis with equal probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. The probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> indicates the probability of an error in a single two-qubit gate. We will assess the logical infidelity of certain state preparation protocols as a function of the physical infidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="subproblems">Checkpoints</h1>
<h2 id="subproblem-1">Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>Suppose that we wish to prepare a logical two-qubit GHZ state  <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB}+|11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> in the [[4,2,2]] code. To do so, we use the following state preparation circuit:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
(CNOT_{03}) (H_0) (CNOT_{21}) (H_2).
\]</div>
<p>Note that this equation is written in matrix multiplication order, while the quantum operations in the circuit occur in the reverse order (from right-to-left in the above equation). <span class="arithmatex">\(H\)</span> is a single-qubit Hadamard gate.</p>
<p>What is the physical state fidelity of the final physical 4-qubit state at the end of the circuit as a function of the two-qubit gate error rate <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>?</p></div>

                        <p>Let me work through this problem step by step.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with the [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code. The code has:
- 4 physical qubits labeled 0,1,2,3
- 2 logical qubits labeled A,B
- Stabilizers: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>
- Logical operators:
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B = XXII\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A = ZZII\)</span>
  - <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B = ZIZI\)</span></p>
<p>The circuit we&rsquo;re considering is:
<span class="arithmatex">\((CNOT_{03})(H_0)(CNOT_{21})(H_2)\)</span></p>
<p>Applied in reverse order (right to left in matrix multiplication):</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(H_2\)</span>: Hadamard on qubit 2</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span>: CNOT with control 2, target 1</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span>: Hadamard on qubit 0</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span>: CNOT with control 0, target 3</li>
</ol>
<p>Each CNOT gate has a two-qubit depolarizing channel after it with error probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s trace through the circuit:</p>
<p>Starting state: <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>After <span class="arithmatex">\(H_2\)</span>: 
<span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |0010\rangle)\)</span></p>
<p>After <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{21}\)</span> (control on qubit 2, target on qubit 1):
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle \to |0000\rangle\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|0010\rangle \to |0110\rangle\)</span></p>
<p>The state becomes <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |0110\rangle)\)</span>. I&rsquo;ll consider the potential error scenarios on qubits 2 and 1. With probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span>, no error occurs. However, there are 15 possible two-qubit Pauli errors, each with probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p/15\)</span>. </p>
<p>The Hadamard on qubit 0 will create a superposition, transforming the state into a complex quantum state with multiple components. The partial state suggests potential entanglement and error propagation through the quantum circuit.</p>
<p>After applying the CNOT gate with control on qubit 0 and target on qubit 3, the state transforms. Some basis states remain unchanged, while others experience controlled bit flips. This demonstrates the intricate quantum operations modifying the quantum information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll investigate the stabilizer conditions for the [[4,2,2]] quantum error correction code. The code space requires specific symmetry properties under <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> operations, which constrain the allowed quantum states.</p>
<p>The ideal state represents a carefully constructed superposition that potentially satisfies these stabilizer constraints. I&rsquo;ll systematically verify whether this state meets the code space requirements by examining how the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> operator acts on the state.</p>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> is applied, it systematically flips all four qubits. Tracing through each basis state reveals a fascinating symmetry: the state transforms in a way that preserves its overall structure, suggesting it remains invariant under this operation.</p>
<p>The parity transformation under <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> introduces additional complexity, tracking how the quantum state&rsquo;s phase changes based on the number of 1s in the computational basis representation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to complete identifying the logical computational basis states, focusing on how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> operators interact to define these fundamental quantum states.</p>
<p>The logical basis states are characterized by their eigenvalues under specific Z-type operators across different qubit registers. Each state represents a unique combination of +1 and -1 eigenvalues for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>, effectively encoding logical quantum information in the stabilizer code&rsquo;s subspace.</p>
<p>I want to systematically explore how these states relate to the underlying quantum error correction mechanism, particularly how they preserve quantum information through carefully constructed stabilizer relationships.</p>
<p>The code space contains eight basis states with even parity, which can be mapped to different logical qubit configurations. By examining the simultaneous eigenstate conditions for <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and logical Z operators, I can construct a comprehensive representation of the quantum code&rsquo;s fundamental states.</p>
<p>My approach involves carefully tracking how each basis state transforms under different stabilizer and logical operators, revealing the intricate structure of this quantum error correction framework.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically analyze the eigenvalue relationships for each logical state, noting how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> interact with the different computational basis states, which provides insight into the code&rsquo;s logical qubit encoding mechanism.</p>
<p>The key observation is how the signs of the eigenvalues change across different logical state configurations, which will be crucial for identifying the precise physical states that correspond to these logical representations.</p>
<p>To characterize these states fully, I&rsquo;ll construct a general state that satisfies two critical constraints: even parity under <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> and symmetric amplitude relationships under <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>. This means the state coefficients must have specific symmetry and parity conditions.</p>
<p>The general state involves a sum over all possible four-qubit basis states, with coefficients that must obey precise symmetry requirements to represent a valid logical qubit in this quantum error correction code.</p>
<p>Specifically, the state comprises four paired configurations with equal amplitudes, creating a 4-dimensional logical subspace that ensures quantum information protection through carefully structured coefficient relationships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll analyze the <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> operator&rsquo;s action on each basis state, tracking its eigenvalue signs. The operator introduces phase flips that reveal critical symmetry constraints for maintaining the code&rsquo;s logical structure. Some states remain unchanged while others acquire a negative sign, which will determine the allowable coefficient combinations.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> transformation suggests specific conditions on the coefficients <span class="arithmatex">\(a,b,c,d\)</span> that preserve the quantum error correction code&rsquo;s fundamental properties. By examining how each basis state transforms, I can derive the necessary algebraic constraints to define the logical qubit&rsquo;s encoding. <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> operation flips sign for specific basis states. Applying <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZII\)</span> to computational basis states reveals sign changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1111\rangle\)</span> remain unchanged</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(|1010\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1001\rangle\)</span> get negative signs</li>
<li>Other states like <span class="arithmatex">\(|0011\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|1100\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|0101\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span> stay positive</li>
</ul>
<p>This transforms the quantum state, creating conditions for potential eigenvalue scenarios. The goal is determining which coefficients must be zero or equal to achieve specific eigenstate properties. <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> acts on qubits 0 and 2, flipping signs for specific basis states. The eigenvalue transformations reveal interesting patterns across different computational basis states. </p>
<p>The state can be decomposed into four key components, with sign changes depending on specific eigenvalue constraints. When <span class="arithmatex">\(b = c = 0\)</span>, the state preserves +1 eigenvalue, while <span class="arithmatex">\(a = d = 0\)</span> indicates -1 eigenvalue scenarios. </p>
<p>The decomposition highlights how quantum states transform under specific symmetry operations, showing nuanced interactions between qubits and their associated operators. I&rsquo;ll carefully apply the quantum state transformation, noting the eigenvalue constraints and state proportionality. The <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span> operation transforms <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> to a superposition of <span class="arithmatex">\(|1010\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|0101\rangle\)</span>, which suggests a connection to the <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span> state. The eigenvalue conditions require specific coefficient constraints, leading to a proportional representation of <span class="arithmatex">\(|0110\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>When examining <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>&rsquo;s action on <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span>, I see a similar transformation generating <span class="arithmatex">\(|1100\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|0011\rangle\)</span>, which relates to <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span>. However, the derived conditions for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> eigenvalues create a contradiction in the coefficient relationships.</p>
<p>The key insight emerges from recognizing these constraints apply to unnormalized states. By carefully analyzing the <span class="arithmatex">\(Z\)</span> eigenvalue conditions, I find complementary relationships: for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(c = \pm d\)</span>, and for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(b = \pm c\)</span>, revealing a more nuanced state transformation mechanism.</p>
<p>Focusing on the detailed state decomposition <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span>, I observe the sign changes under <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> specifically impact the <span class="arithmatex">\(|0101\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1010\rangle\)</span> components, suggesting a delicate interplay between coefficient constraints and quantum state symmetries.</p>
<p>The requirement for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle\)</span> forces <span class="arithmatex">\(c = 0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(d = 0\)</span>, effectively eliminating certain quantum state configurations. Similarly, for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|\psi\rangle = -|\psi\rangle\)</span>, the conditions demand <span class="arithmatex">\(a = 0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(b = 0\)</span>, further restricting the quantum state&rsquo;s possible representations.</p>
<p>These constraints reveal a precise mathematical structure governing the quantum state&rsquo;s behavior under specific symmetry transformations.</p>
<p>For <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>, the analysis becomes more nuanced. The eigenvalue conditions for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> impose additional constraints on the quantum state&rsquo;s coefficients, systematically reducing the degrees of freedom in the state&rsquo;s construction.</p>
<p>The first eigenvalue case for <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle\)</span> requires <span class="arithmatex">\(b = 0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(c = 0\)</span>. Conversely, when <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B|\psi\rangle = -|\psi\rangle\)</span>, the conditions dictate <span class="arithmatex">\(a = 0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(d = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>These intricate constraints suggest a highly structured quantum state with specific symmetry properties.</p>
<p>The basis states reveal a fascinating pattern:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB}\)</span> maps to <span class="arithmatex">\(N(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|01\rangle_{AB}\)</span> maps to <span class="arithmatex">\(N(|0011\rangle + |1100\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|10\rangle_{AB}\)</span> maps to <span class="arithmatex">\(N(|0110\rangle + |1001\rangle)\)</span>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(|11\rangle_{AB}\)</span> maps to <span class="arithmatex">\(N(|0101\rangle + |1010\rangle)\)</span></p>
<p>Each state exhibits a precise normalization and entanglement structure.</p>
<p>The ideal quantum state emerges as a superposition combining specific basis configurations, suggesting a balanced quantum representation with equal probability amplitudes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m carefully manipulating the quantum state, breaking down the complex expression into simplified components. The goal is to express the state in a more manageable form using tensor product notation and normalized coefficients.</p>
<p>By systematically rearranging the quantum amplitudes, I&rsquo;m revealing an elegant representation that connects different computational basis states through precise quantum transformations.</p>
<p>I notice a critical discrepancy between the current state and the desired target state, which requires careful circuit verification and step-by-step quantum gate analysis.</p>
<p>The Hadamard gate and CNOT operations are progressively transforming the initial state, with each quantum gate introducing specific entanglement and superposition characteristics.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> gate creates a superposition across the first and fourth qubits, expanding the quantum state&rsquo;s complexity by generating additional basis state combinations. This transformation increases the state&rsquo;s dimensionality while maintaining quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The subsequent <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> gate will likely introduce controlled bit-flip operations between specific qubits, potentially modifying the quantum state&rsquo;s entanglement structure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m noticing some uncertainty about the precise quantum state preparation, which suggests a need to carefully verify the logical state identification and circuit outcomes. The goal seems to involve preparing a specific entangled state, but the current circuit configuration may not fully achieve the desired quantum configuration.</p>
<p>The analysis requires a careful re-examination of the quantum gates&rsquo; transformative effects and their cumulative impact on the quantum system&rsquo;s state representation. <span class="arithmatex">\(= \frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0101\rangle + |1010\rangle)\)</span>, which differs from our state of <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{2}(|0000\rangle + |1001\rangle + |0110\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span>. </p>
<p>Reconsidering the approach, I&rsquo;ll directly examine the logical operators. Specifically, I&rsquo;ll investigate <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A = XIXI\)</span> and its effect on the initial state <span class="arithmatex">\(|00\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle)\)</span>. This systematic exploration might reveal insights into the state&rsquo;s transformation and potential logical mapping.</p>
<p>The key observation is that logical operators are defined &ldquo;up to multiplication by stabilizers&rdquo;, which introduces complexity in precisely identifying their action. Different representations like <span class="arithmatex">\(XIXI\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(IXIX\)</span> could potentially represent equivalent logical transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m noticing subtle discrepancies in state representations that suggest deeper structural nuances in this quantum error correction code&rsquo;s logical operator definitions.</p>
<p>By examining the commutation relations between proposed logical operators <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>, I can verify their fundamental algebraic properties. The anti-commutation relationships between X and Z operators on different qubit subspaces will be critical for establishing the logical operator consistency.</p>
<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;ll focus on checking whether <span class="arithmatex">\([X_A, Z_A]\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\([X_B, Z_B]\)</span> exhibit the expected quantum computational basis transformations, which requires careful tracking of sign changes and qubit interactions during operator applications.</p>
<p>The verification confirms these logical operators satisfy the necessary commutation constraints, indicating they represent valid quantum error correction code operators that preserve the underlying quantum information encoding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically explore the computational basis states within the code space, focusing on the joint eigenstates of <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span>. These states represent the fundamental quantum information configurations that maintain the code&rsquo;s structural integrity.</p>
<p>The code space reveals four key symmetric superposition states, each representing a distinct quantum information configuration. By examining how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> interact with these states, I can determine their eigenvalue characteristics and validate their quantum error correction properties.</p>
<p>Initial analysis shows the first state <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle + |1111\rangle\)</span> maintains its form under <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, suggesting a +1 eigenvalue. The subsequent state <span class="arithmatex">\(|0011\rangle + |1100\rangle\)</span> exhibits more complex transformation behavior, with <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> introducing a sign change.</p>
<p>To ensure precision, I&rsquo;ll normalize these states, creating a well-defined orthonormal basis that captures the quantum code&rsquo;s essential symmetries and error correction mechanisms.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> transforms these states in predictable ways: <span class="arithmatex">\(|s_1\rangle\)</span> remains unchanged, while the other states acquire phase shifts. Specifically, <span class="arithmatex">\(|s_2\rangle\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(|s_3\rangle\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(|s_4\rangle\)</span> experience sign modifications that disrupt their original form.</p>
<p>These transformations suggest the states are not pure eigenstates of <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, indicating complex interactions within the quantum error correction framework. The non-trivial behavior hints at deeper structural properties of the quantum code&rsquo;s underlying symmetry group.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group&rsquo;s generators - <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> - reveal a rich algebraic structure. By including <span class="arithmatex">\(YYYY\)</span> as a derived element, the group captures intricate quantum correlations across the four-qubit system.</p>
<p>Exploring the logical GHZ state preparation becomes the next critical step, requiring careful consideration of these quantum mechanical constraints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll map out the target and ideal states, revealing subtle differences in their quantum configurations. The physical qubit representations expose nuanced variations between <span class="arithmatex">\((|00\rangle_{AB} + |11\rangle_{AB})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> and the circuit&rsquo;s actual output state.</p>
<p>The state comparison suggests a potential fidelity calculation will illuminate the quantum circuit&rsquo;s performance relative to the desired quantum state.</p>
<p>Calculating the inner product reveals an unexpected result: the fidelity is <span class="arithmatex">\(1/4\)</span>, which seems counterintuitive for a quantum circuit designed to generate a specific entangled state.</p>
<p>This discrepancy indicates the quantum circuit might not precisely match the intended logical qubit transformation, warranting further investigation into the state preparation mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully re-examine the logical operator definitions and their stabilizer equivalence classes. The operators <span class="arithmatex">\(X_A\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(X_B\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> have complex symmetries within the stabilizer group, suggesting multiple potential state representations that could impact the quantum computation&rsquo;s accuracy.</p>
<p>The equivalence classes for <span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{X_A}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\overline{X_B}\)</span> reveal intricate symmetry transformations that might explain the unexpected fidelity calculation, hinting at a more nuanced quantum state preparation strategy.</p>
<p>I need to methodically trace the algebraic relationships between these logical operators, paying close attention to how stabilizer group elements modify their fundamental representations.</p>
<p>The computational basis requires finding eigenstates that simultaneously diagonalize <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> within a specific code space. This involves constructing quantum states with precise superposition characteristics across multiple qubits, where each <span class="arithmatex">\(|+\rangle\)</span> state represents a carefully constructed entangled configuration.</p>
<p>The key is identifying how these <span class="arithmatex">\(|+\rangle\)</span> states interact and form a coherent quantum computational framework that preserves specific symmetry properties. I&rsquo;ll carefully compute the action of <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> on the basis states, noting the unexpected result with <span class="arithmatex">\(|+\rangle_2\)</span>. The eigenstate <span class="arithmatex">\(|-\rangle_2\)</span> appears problematic, as it&rsquo;s not consistent with the code space&rsquo;s constraints. I need to investigate how <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> interacts with this state to understand why it doesn&rsquo;t fit the quantum error correction code&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>The key observation is that logical operators must map code states to code states. My current approach reveals a subtle complexity in how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> transforms the quantum states within this specific basis. I&rsquo;ll need to carefully analyze the matrix representation to understand the precise transformation rules.</p>
<p>The code space&rsquo;s 4-dimensional structure means <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_B\)</span> have interesting commutation properties. By systematically computing how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> acts on each basis state, I can construct its matrix representation, revealing how it preserves the code space&rsquo;s fundamental structure.</p>
<p>The first column&rsquo;s computation shows <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> preserves <span class="arithmatex">\(|+\rangle_1\)</span>, suggesting a non-trivial mapping for other basis states. The next step involves expressing <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A|+\rangle_2\)</span> in the code basis, which requires careful decomposition of the quantum state.</p>
<p>By expressing <span class="arithmatex">\(|0011\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|1100\rangle\)</span> in terms of <span class="arithmatex">\(|+\rangle_2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|-\rangle_2\)</span>, I can derive the precise transformation. The calculation reveals a sign change that highlights the operator&rsquo;s intricate action on the quantum states.</p>
<p>I realize my initial assumption about normalization was incorrect. The states <span class="arithmatex">\(|0011\rangle + |1100\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|0011\rangle - |1100\rangle\)</span> are not normalized as I previously thought. This means my earlier reasoning about eigenvector decomposition needs careful reconsideration.</p>
<p>Instead of attempting diagonalization, I&rsquo;ll directly compute the matrix elements to understand the operator&rsquo;s behavior more precisely. The matrix element calculation will provide clearer insight into how <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_A\)</span> acts within this quantum system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shifting my approach to focus on the circuit&rsquo;s fidelity, given potential errors in the quantum gates. The specific circuit involves Hadamard gates and CNOT operations with potential error mechanisms that could significantly impact the quantum state preparation.</p>
<p>Each CNOT gate is followed by a depolarizing noise channel, which introduces random quantum errors probabilistically. This channel mathematically models how real physical quantum gates deviate from ideal operations, representing noise that can randomize the quantum state.</p>
<p>The problem requires calculating the physical state fidelity between the actual noisy state and the intended ideal quantum state. This involves comparing the final state after error introduction with the perfectly prepared target state.</p>
<p>The ideal target state appears to be a specific superposition involving multiple basis states, suggesting a complex entangled quantum configuration that the circuit aims to generate.</p>
<p>The quantum circuit proceeds through several stages, introducing Hadamard gates and controlled-NOT operations while simultaneously tracking how noise progressively affects the quantum state&rsquo;s coherence and entanglement.</p>
<p>The error process involves probabilistic transformations on specific qubit pairs, with a comprehensive set of potential error configurations mapped across different qubit indices.</p>
<p>The final state&rsquo;s fidelity calculation requires tracking the quantum state&rsquo;s evolution through multiple unitary and error channel transformations, with the goal of quantifying how noise impacts quantum information preservation.</p>
<p>The analysis aims to systematically break down the quantum state&rsquo;s progression, computing the state&rsquo;s characteristics order by order in the error probability parameter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully track how the initial quantum state transforms under Hadamard gates, CNOT operations, and probabilistic error channels, focusing on maintaining the quantum information&rsquo;s integrity through each transformation.</p>
<p>The quantum state evolves through precise unitary operations, with <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> representing a specific Hadamard transformation. By decomposing <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_2\rangle\)</span> into computational basis states, I can systematically track how the quantum state changes under these transformations.</p>
<p>The key observation involves expressing <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_3\rangle\)</span> as a linear combination of transformed basis states, revealing the intricate quantum mechanical evolution of the system under these operations.</p>
<p>The density matrix <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho'_2\)</span> captures this evolution probabilistically, incorporating both the unperturbed state and a carefully weighted sum of potential quantum state variations.</p>
<p>I notice the operators <span class="arithmatex">\(H_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{21}\)</span> actually commute across different qubit subspaces, which simplifies the transformation. This commutativity allows me to rearrange the terms more cleanly, revealing a symmetric interaction between the quantum permutation and Hadamard operations.</p>
<p>The key insight is how the operators interact across different qubits, enabling a more elegant representation of the quantum state&rsquo;s probabilistic evolution.</p>
<p>After applying the <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> gate, the quantum state transforms into an ideal superposition <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span>, which represents a balanced entanglement across the four-qubit system. This transformation captures the probabilistic nature of the quantum operation, blending the original state with potential permutation errors.</p>
<p>The resulting density matrix <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho_3\)</span> reflects this probabilistic evolution, maintaining the core quantum information while incorporating potential quantum noise through the error parameter <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The commutation of <span class="arithmatex">\(CNOT_{03}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{21}\)</span> gates highlights the independent action of quantum operations on disjoint qubit sets, demonstrating the modular nature of quantum circuit transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll represent the mixed state density matrix, incorporating error probabilities across specific qubit subspaces, capturing the probabilistic quantum channel&rsquo;s behavior through a weighted sum of ideal and error-induced states.</p>
<p>The notation emphasizes the systematic exploration of potential error configurations, mapping quantum state variations through precise operator manipulations.</p>
<p>Specifically, the final density matrix captures the cumulative error effects across different qubit subsets, with each term representing a probabilistic quantum state transformation.</p>
<p>The mathematical structure reveals a nuanced probabilistic quantum evolution, where the ideal state progressively accumulates error contributions across distinct quantum subsystems.</p>
<p>Calculating the fidelity involves tracking the probability-weighted quantum state modifications, systematically quantifying the deviation from the initial quantum configuration through carefully constructed projection operators.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll compute the expectation values by analyzing how specific quantum gates transform the ideal quantum state. The ideal state represents a superposition of four basis states, and I&rsquo;ll track how different single-qubit operations modify this state&rsquo;s amplitudes and phases.</p>
<p>For the first projection involving qubit operations, I&rsquo;ll examine how the <span class="arithmatex">\(I_2 \otimes X_1\)</span> operator transforms the quantum state, tracking the resulting amplitude changes and phase relationships.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(I_2 \otimes Y_1\)</span> operation introduces complex phase shifts, demonstrating how imaginary unit transformations modify quantum state representations. By carefully tracking these phase interactions, I can determine the expectation value&rsquo;s zero result.</p>
<p>The <span class="arithmatex">\(I_2 \otimes Z_1\)</span> operation introduces sign changes based on qubit state, revealing how phase-based quantum gates interact with the ideal quantum state&rsquo;s configuration.</p>
<p>Critically, all non-identity Pauli operators generate zero expectation values for this stabilizer state. This fundamental property emerges from the state&rsquo;s inherent symmetry, where Pauli transformations either preserve or orthogonally map the quantum configuration.</p>
<p>Consequently, the final fidelity calculation simplifies to <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span>, capturing the quantum system&rsquo;s probabilistic evolution.</p>
<p>However, this initial derivation seems overly straightforward. The squared magnitude of expectation values requires deeper scrutiny, particularly regarding how small error probabilities impact the overall quantum state fidelity.</p>
<p>The error model introduces nuanced probabilistic dynamics: with probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, a non-identity two-qubit Pauli operator perturbs the quantum state, while with probability <span class="arithmatex">\(1-p\)</span>, the system remains undisturbed.</p>
<p>I need to carefully examine how these cross terms might contribute to the final state&rsquo;s fidelity, especially considering the specific constraints of stabilizer states and their interaction with Pauli operators.</p>
<p>The mathematical structure suggests that the fidelity&rsquo;s behavior will be nonlinear with respect to the error probability, potentially revealing subtle quantum error characteristics.</p>
<p>For a stabilizer state like <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span>, the key constraint is that Pauli operators must either leave the state unchanged or generate a phase shift to potentially contribute to the cross terms.</p>
<p>The specific state <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span> has a unique stabilizer group that will determine which Pauli operators can interact with it without destroying quantum coherence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically verify which Pauli operators preserve the state&rsquo;s structure, noting that <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span> are already confirmed stabilizers. The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0 Z_3\)</span> operator reveals more complexity, as it changes sign for certain basis states, indicating it&rsquo;s not a stabilizer.</p>
<p>The next step involves exploring additional Pauli combinations to fully characterize the state&rsquo;s symmetry properties. I notice the state&rsquo;s symmetry between qubits 0-3 and 1-2. When checking <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0 Z_3\)</span>, the sign alternation disrupts the state&rsquo;s balanced structure. Decomposing the state reveals a tensor product pattern across qubit pairs, showing a symmetric entanglement where the first two qubits and last two qubits share correlated states.</p>
<p>The representation suggests a generalized GHZ-like state, with each qubit pair exhibiting complementary quantum configurations that maintain overall coherence. This symmetry hints at deeper quantum correlations beyond simple binary relationships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to carefully track the potential Pauli operator interactions across different qubit subspaces, focusing on non-trivial two-qubit interactions that might reveal intricate quantum mechanical properties.</p>
<p>The notation implies complex entanglement patterns where specific qubit combinations could yield non-zero expectation values under certain operator transformations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll systematically examine these non-identity two-qubit Pauli operators, checking their effects on the ideal quantum state by computing their action and orthogonality relationships.</p>
<p>The stabilizer <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2 Z_1\)</span> appears significant, as it preserves the quantum state&rsquo;s structure. By exploring interactions between different qubit pairs, I&rsquo;m discovering which error operators might play a crucial role in maintaining quantum coherence.</p>
<p>My investigation suggests a selective subset of error operators could potentially contribute to the state&rsquo;s stability, rather than all possible combinations being equally relevant.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group contains multiple generators that interact in complex ways. I&rsquo;m systematically identifying these generators: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(IZZI\)</span>, each representing a unique transformation that preserves the quantum state&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>The interplay between these stabilizers hints at a deeper algebraic structure governing the quantum system&rsquo;s error correction mechanism. By examining their products and commutation relationships, I aim to uncover the fourth independent generator that completes the stabilizer group.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve verified that <span class="arithmatex">\(IZZI\)</span> indeed stabilizes the ideal state, maintaining its quantum coherence across different qubit configurations.</p>
<p>Examining the non-identity two-qubit Paulis on qubits 2 and 1, I find only <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2 Z_1\)</span> is part of the stabilizer group, which maps to <span class="arithmatex">\(IZZI\)</span> across all four qubits.</p>
<p>In the first error channel, the <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZ\)</span> error exclusively impacts fidelity, contributing a specific probabilistic term that scales with the error rate and the limited set of Pauli operators affecting these qubits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sensing potential nuance in my previous calculation that requires more rigorous analysis of the stabilizer group&rsquo;s properties.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s stabilizer generators include three independent operators: <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZZZ\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(IZZI\)</span>. These three generators suggest a need for a fourth independent generator to fully characterize the 4-qubit stabilizer state.</p>
<p>The stabilizer group&rsquo;s structure implies 16 total elements when accounting for phase variations, though typically we consider 8 distinct elements for a pure state. My next step involves identifying this critical fourth generator through careful commutation checks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m examining potential generators like <span class="arithmatex">\(ZIIZ\)</span>, systematically testing its compatibility with the existing stabilizer group and state structure. The goal is finding an operator that both commutes with existing generators and provides independent information about the quantum state.</p>
<p>Focusing on two-qubit Pauli operators across different qubit pairs, I&rsquo;m methodically checking which combinations produce non-zero expectation values. The <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2 Z_1\)</span> operator appears particularly promising for revealing state characteristics.</p>
<p>My current investigation involves probing specific tensor product combinations, particularly those involving <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_3\)</span>, to understand potential symmetries and stabilizer relationships within this quantum state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve confirmed that both <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_1 X_2\)</span> stabilize the ideal state, revealing an intriguing symmetry where these cross-qubit operators preserve the quantum configuration. This systematic verification suggests deeper structural properties embedded in the quantum system.</p>
<p>The pattern suggests these specific two-qubit Pauli operators play a crucial role in maintaining the state&rsquo;s coherence and fundamental quantum mechanical properties.</p>
<p>When examining the stabilizer set, I notice an interesting algebraic relationship: <span class="arithmatex">\(XIIX \cdot IXXI = XXXX\)</span>, indicating these operators are not truly independent but interconnected through multiplication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring a potential set of stabilizer generators that might capture the essential symmetries of this quantum state, focusing on systematic selection to reveal the underlying quantum mechanical constraints.</p>
<p>The ideal state reveals intriguing symmetry properties. Specifically, when checking error operators, I find that <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2 Z_1\)</span> produces a non-zero expectation value of 1, suggesting a unique interaction between these particular qubits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in understanding which error operators significantly impact the quantum state&rsquo;s characteristics, rather than exhaustively cataloging every possible stabilizer.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculation unfolds through a systematic breakdown, revealing how error probabilities progressively modify the quantum system&rsquo;s integrity. By carefully tracking terms with <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, I derive a nuanced expression capturing the state&rsquo;s resilience against quantum noise.</p>
<p>The final fidelity expression elegantly captures the system&rsquo;s probabilistic behavior, showing how small perturbations incrementally degrade the quantum state&rsquo;s precision. I&rsquo;m exploring the mathematical details of a quantum state transformation, carefully tracking the evolution through multiple quantum operations. The process involves applying Hadamard gates, CNOT gates, and error channels sequentially to an initial state <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up intermediate state representations to track the quantum system&rsquo;s progression, breaking down the complex transformation step by step. The notation suggests a careful analysis of quantum error processes across multiple qubits, with precise transformations applied at each stage.</p>
<p>The formula indicates a sophisticated quantum circuit with multiple gates and error channels, requiring meticulous tracking of state changes through different quantum operations. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous thinking first:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(+ (1-p)\frac{p}{15}\sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}_{21}} |P\psi_{ideal}\rangle\langle P\psi_{ideal}|\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\(|P\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span> represents the transformed state after applying Pauli operations and quantum gates. The notation slightly generalizes Pauli transformations across the entire 4-qubit quantum system.</p>
<p>When applying the second error channel, the final density matrix evolves with two error contributions: one from the first error channel and another from the second error channel. The probability terms <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)p/15\)</span> capture the cumulative error dynamics across different Pauli transformations.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculation breaks down each term systematically, revealing how specific Pauli operations contribute to the overall quantum state preservation. Only certain Pauli transformations, like <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span>, significantly impact the quantum state&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>When analyzing the Pauli operators <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span>, I recognize the need for precise operator definitions, ensuring they act selectively on specific qubits while maintaining identity on others. This careful decomposition allows for a nuanced understanding of quantum state evolution.</p>
<p>Focusing on the probability calculation, I observe the fidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(F\)</span> emerges from a combination of terms involving <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>, with contributions from different quantum state configurations. The expression captures the probabilistic nature of quantum state transformations, revealing how small perturbations impact overall system behavior.</p>
<p>The next step involves investigating the <span class="arithmatex">\(O(p^2)\)</span> term, which requires examining the final density matrix&rsquo;s remaining components to complete the comprehensive fidelity calculation.</p>
<p>The summation involves specific quantum permutation sets <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{P}_{21}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{P}_{03}\)</span>, suggesting a systematic exploration of quantum state overlaps and their squared magnitudes. This approach allows precise quantification of quantum state fidelity under probabilistic transformations.</p>
<p>To ensure non-zero contributions, I need specific stabilizer operators <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span> that interact with the ideal quantum state <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span>. I&rsquo;ll investigate the product of two stabilizer operators <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2 Z_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span>, examining their combined effect on the quantum state.</p>
<p>Their product <span class="arithmatex">\(QP\)</span> generates a complex interaction represented by <span class="arithmatex">\(XIZX\)</span>, which transforms the basis states in a non-trivial manner. I&rsquo;ll carefully trace how this operator acts on the computational basis states to determine its stabilizing properties.</p>
<p>After detailed calculation, I find this cross term does not preserve the ideal quantum state&rsquo;s structure. The transformed state is not proportional to the original, indicating no additional stabilization emerges from this specific operator combination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore alternative operator combinations, focusing on identity terms and their potential contributions to state preservation. The analysis suggests most cross terms provide minimal or no meaningful stabilization beyond the already identified operators.</p>
<p>Systematically examining two-qubit Pauli operators on disjoint qubit pairs reveals complex interactions. The key challenge is identifying specific combinations that generate genuine stabilizers without disrupting the quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental symmetry.</p>
<p>By analyzing <span class="arithmatex">\(QP\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(Q\)</span> acts on qubits 0,3 and <span class="arithmatex">\(P\)</span> acts on qubits 2,1, certain tensor product combinations emerge as stabilizers. Specifically, combinations like <span class="arithmatex">\((X_0 X_3) \otimes (X_2 X_1)\)</span> produce the <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> stabilizer.</p>
<p>The non-identity error scenario with <span class="arithmatex">\((Q,P) = (XX, XX)\)</span> contributes <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p^2}{225}\)</span> to the overall fidelity calculation. This precise contribution reflects the nuanced quantum error dynamics at play.</p>
<p>The total fidelity expression captures these intricate error interactions, balancing quantum coherence against probabilistic perturbations.</p>
<p>Expanding the algebraic terms reveals a structured progression: starting from <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span>, incorporating cross-terms <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{2p(1-p)}{15}\)</span>, and accounting for higher-order error probabilities <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{p^2}{225}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The algebraic manipulation systematically simplifies the complex quantum error representation, distilling the core probabilistic essence of the quantum system&rsquo;s resilience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking how the fidelity expression transforms, revealing the intricate relationship between error probability and quantum state preservation.</p>
<p>The depolarizing channel&rsquo;s impact becomes clearer through these algebraic steps, suggesting a nuanced understanding of quantum error dynamics.</p>
<p>By exploring the fidelity calculation for two-qubit systems, I&rsquo;m uncovering how independent error channels interact and potentially compromise quantum information integrity.</p>
<p>The mathematical progression hints at deeper insights into quantum error correction mechanisms, particularly how small probabilities can significantly affect quantum state reliability.</p>
<p>My analysis suggests the need for a more comprehensive examination of how errors propagate through quantum circuits, especially in multi-qubit configurations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m systematically investigating each possible Pauli error combination, recognizing that seemingly minor perturbations can fundamentally alter quantum state representations.</p>
<p>The current investigation focuses on understanding how different error types map ideal quantum states to orthogonal spaces, which could critically impact quantum computation reliability.</p>
<p>For the <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2 X_1\)</span> case, I&rsquo;ve discovered something fascinating: this operation actually preserves the original quantum state, effectively functioning as a stabilizer rather than introducing an error. This challenges my initial assumption about state transformation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue methodically examining each potential two-qubit Pauli interaction, tracking how they interact with the ideal quantum state and determining whether they generate orthogonal states or maintain state coherence.</p>
<p>On qubits 0 and 3, I notice an intriguing asymmetry: while <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span> stabilizes consistently, <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_0 Z_3\)</span> produces a different state vector that doesn&rsquo;t align with the original quantum configuration.</p>
<p>The fidelity calculation becomes more nuanced, incorporating error probabilities and stabilizer interactions. I track pairs of error operators that preserve the quantum state&rsquo;s fundamental structure, specifically examining how their products interact with the ideal quantum configuration.</p>
<p>For instance, the combination of <span class="arithmatex">\(X_0 X_3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2 X_1\)</span> generates a stabilizing <span class="arithmatex">\(XXXX\)</span> operator, which significantly influences the overall quantum system&rsquo;s stability.</p>
<p>The mathematical representation captures these complex interactions through a probabilistic framework, weighing the likelihood of different error scenarios and their collective impact on quantum coherence.</p>
<p>The refined equation elegantly captures these quantum mechanical subtleties, expressing fidelity as a sophisticated function of error probabilities and stabilizer dynamics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll break down the error scenarios systematically:</p>
<ol>
<li>No gate errors result in perfect state preservation.</li>
<li>First gate errors occur with probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p(1-p)\)</span>, where 2 out of 15 Pauli operators (<span class="arithmatex">\(XX\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(ZZ\)</span> on specific qubits) maintain state integrity.</li>
<li>Second gate errors happen with probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)p\)</span>, with 1 out of 15 Pauli operators (<span class="arithmatex">\(XX\)</span> on specific qubits) preserving the quantum state.</li>
<li>Dual gate errors introduce more complex probabilistic interactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each scenario contributes nuanced probabilistic components to the overall quantum system&rsquo;s fidelity, reflecting the intricate quantum error landscape.</p>
<p>The total fidelity calculation elegantly captures these probabilistic error modes, showing how quantum coherence degrades under different error scenarios.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carefully track the CNOT gate&rsquo;s depolarizing channel, which introduces 15 possible non-identity Pauli errors with equal probability. The error model mathematically represents how quantum information can be randomly perturbed during gate operations.</p>
<p>The final fidelity expression <span class="arithmatex">\(F = 1 - \frac{9p}{5} + \frac{181p^2}{225}\)</span> succinctly captures the quantum error dynamics, revealing how error probability progressively impacts quantum state preservation.</p>
<p>By expanding the squared term, I notice a discrepancy between <span class="arithmatex">\((1 - \frac{9p}{5})^2\)</span> and my derived result. This suggests the need for meticulous algebraic verification to ensure the fidelity calculation&rsquo;s accuracy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll methodically expand <span class="arithmatex">\((1 - \frac{9p}{5})^2\)</span> to confirm the mathematical consistency, comparing each term carefully to validate the quantum error correction model&rsquo;s precision.</p>
<p>The algebraic manipulation reveals a nuanced transformation, where the fractional coefficients require precise tracking through each computational step. By systematically collecting and simplifying terms, I can reconcile the potential computational variations and establish the most accurate representation of the quantum fidelity function.</p>
<p>The final expression emerges as <span class="arithmatex">\(F = 1 - \frac{9p}{5} + \frac{181p^2}{225}\)</span>, presenting an intriguing structural form that invites further algebraic investigation.</p>
<p>My attention now turns to understanding the potential simplification through prime factorization, specifically examining the relationship between 181 and 225. The initial observations suggest a complex numerical landscape, with 225 being clearly decomposable into <span class="arithmatex">\(9 \times 5^2\)</span>, while 181 presents a more enigmatic profile.</p>
<p>The preliminary divisibility test for 181 begins methodically, first ruling out even number divisibility and preparing for a systematic prime factor exploration. I&rsquo;ll complete the partial thought from the previous thinking first:</p>
<p>The depolarizing channel has the property that it shrinks the Bloch vector by a factor, except along the directions of its fixed points (the Paulis that commute with the channel). But in this case, the errors are on different qubits at different times, so this perspective doesn&rsquo;t directly apply.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll summarize the key points concisely:</p>
<p>The standard channel analysis doesn&rsquo;t fully capture the error dynamics here. The specific error model involves independent errors across different qubits and times, which complicates the standard depolarizing channel interpretation. The original formula remains the most direct representation of the fidelity.</p>

<div class="content markdown-body"><p>Looking at this problem, I need to trace through the quantum circuit and calculate how errors affect the final state fidelity.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-derivation">Step-by-Step Derivation</h2>
<p>Starting with the initial state <span class="arithmatex">\(|0000\rangle\)</span>, let me trace through the circuit operations:</p>

<p><strong>After error channel on qubits (2,1):</strong>
The depolarizing channel acts as:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathcal{E}_{21}(\rho) = (1-p)\rho + \frac{p}{15}\sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}_{21}} P\rho P^\dagger
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathcal{P}_{21}\)</span> are the 15 non-identity two-qubit Paulis on qubits 2,1.</p>

<p><strong>After error channel on qubits (0,3):</strong>
Another depolarizing channel is applied.</p>
<p>To compute the fidelity <span class="arithmatex">\(F = \langle\psi_{ideal}|\rho_{final}|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span>, I need to determine which error operators preserve <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span>.</p>

<p>The state <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span> is stabilized by operators that leave it invariant. Let me check which two-qubit Paulis stabilize it:</p>
<p><strong>For qubits (2,1):</strong>
- <span class="arithmatex">\(X_2 X_1|\psi_{ideal}\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|0110\rangle + |1111\rangle + |0000\rangle + |1001\rangle) = |\psi_{ideal}\rangle\)</span> âœ“

<h2 id="fidelity-calculation">Fidelity Calculation</h2>
<p>The fidelity has contributions from:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>No errors on either gate:</strong> Probability <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span>, contributes <span class="arithmatex">\((1-p)^2\)</span> to fidelity</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Error on first gate only:</strong> Among the 15 error operators on qubits (2,1), two preserve the state (<span class="arithmatex">\(X_2X_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(Z_2Z_1\)</span>). This contributes:</p>
